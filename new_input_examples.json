This Shiner Gold does indeed have superior hold to most anything else I've used.  Your hair will stay in place all day long and then some.  But what really impressed me is that it also seems to tame and soften your hair at the same time.  I'm leaving this review 30 hours after applying the product and my hair still looks excellent.<br /><br />It does not have a greasy texture to it nor do you get that &#34;clumpy&#34; feeling as Suavecito can sometimes do.<br /><br />My only complaint - and it's a minor one - is the smell.<br /><br />Some people don't like Suavecito's smell.  I love it.  It smells like cologne.  As a man surely you can understand why that's a good thing.  I don't find Suavecito's smell to be overpowerful, and frankly you can't smell it 2 hours later anyway.<br /><br />Shiner Gold?  Smells like a pi\u00f1a colada, the smell lingers, and I can't stand it.  It is for this reason I can't apply it on my goatee; there I fall back to Suavecito.
