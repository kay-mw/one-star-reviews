[TASK] 
Analyze the attached data containing product reviews and provide
evaluations in JSON format.

[EVALUATION CRITERIA] 
For each review, evaluate based on: 1. How detailed and
useful the information is. 2. How factual and unbiased the review is. 3. How
relevant the is review to the product.

You will use these evaluation criteria to generate an overall quality rating,
from 0-10. This represents how useful you consider the review, given the
evaluation criterion above.

[EVALUATION EXAMPLES] 
Here is an example of a very high quality review, which
would score a 10 in informative, objectivity, and overall quality:

"I ordered Tianeptine sulfate from Nootropic source. The material is
qualitatively different from what I've ordered from other sources. It’s a
dense, free flowing powder instead of very light, fluffy powder. Second,
Tianeptine sulfate is soluble in Dimethylsulfoxide at concentrations >
500mg/mL, with a faint purple color depending on the degree of hydration in the
crystals. N.S. product had insolubles at 250mg/mL and was faint yellow. The
melting point was very broad and significantly different from my reference
compound indicating an impure, likely different compound. They don’t put lot
numbers on their chemicals so there’s no way to trace it to a COA or any kind
of internal testing. Very sloppy QC, I wouldn’t put something like this in my
body."

Here is an example of a very low quality review, which would score a 0 in
informative, objectivity, and overall quality:

"RUDE! RUDE! RUDE! CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPERVISOR!!!"

[INSTRUCTIONS]
