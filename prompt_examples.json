I don't find Suavecito's smell to be overpowerful, and frankly you can't smell it 2 hours later anyway.<br /><br />Shiner Gold?

This album doesn't need a fluffy, Ke$ha-sounding pop tart track infused with some Snoop to promote the decency.  \"E.T.\" would have been a way better choice, (despite its sounding like it was produced by t.A.T.u).<br /><br />Katy Perry is probably best described as the P!nk for the teenage girls sector.  She has enough bubble gum flavor on her tracks to appeal to the younger minds but she has enough honesty and personal experience in her lyrics for girls who are seeking a big sister's advice.  She could even be considered a milder Lady Gaga, considering her costumes and bisexual curiosity.<br /><br />But enough of what she could be and on to what she is.  Perry is, through these lyrics, a girl who has been hurt by a man she loved.  Perry is now a strong woman who \"used to be a shell\".<br /><br />Perry has attitude.  She has something to say and she's going to make sure you hear it.<br /><br />Teenage Dream is a strong follow-up to One of the Boys.  Perry still maintains her cutesie sweetness and it seems almost as if Perry is permanently stuck in her teenage years.  It's hard to believe that such a fun-loving party girl with a juvenile state of mind is going to be a married woman soon.<br /><br />\"Not Like the Movies\" is one of my favorite tracks on this album.  Here, Perry gets more personal than ever before, with lyrics describing a first sexual encounter that is nothing like fairy tales promised.  It hurts, physically and emotionally, and now she knows when she will be ready for the right one because now she knows what not being ready feels like.  Her breathy sadness here will touch you and make you remember feelings you may have long forgotten.<br /><br />\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\" is a rocker akin to \"Waking Up in Vegas\" from her first album, only with the last remaining traces of innocence stripped clean.  On \"Circle the Drain\", Perry expresses delicious anger.  This is not a song you would want to blast at work.  Well, unless explicit lyrics are allowed where you work.  The title track has the hook to grab you in but it's inferior to some of the other work here.  \"Pearl\" reminds me of \"Dance in the Dark\" by Lady Gaga since it is yet another song about a girl who has potential and a lot of life in her but is held down by the man in her life who fears her power.<br /><br />\"Who Am I Living For?\" is an excellent display of Perry's vocals laced over that all-too-addictive Timbaland beat.  This is my favorite track on the disc, hands down.  \"Peacock\", however, is mainly a miss.  At first listen, it reminded me of \"Mickey\" by Toni Basil if it was re-done by Gwen Stefani.  A girl with her emotional depth does not need to rely on such a stupid expression of suggestion.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is an excellent second album for Perry.  She demonstrates growth here, a willingness to change her sound up without going overboard.  If you liked the first album, I strongly suggest this one.

I loved them!  Wow, what a change occured the next year.  Folk and rock music took over suddenly.  So much for jazz.<br />I say all this to emphasize the fact that Cannonball's reception in 1962 was warm.  He and his group not only played the best swinging straight ahead jazz, but Cannon used his warm personality to speak between numbers to explain and expound upon the meaning behind the music.  This is very different from many jazz musicians who were mute.  You were lucky if they announced the title of the song, let alone any other info.<br />On this recording, you get the live experience of Cannon and his groups recorded between 1967 and 1968 on Alan Grant's live radio broadcasts from the legendary Half Note club in NYC.  It is enjoyable music.  The quintet with Nat Adderly on cornet is on half the numbers, and half are by the quintet with Charles Lloyd on tenor.  Joe Zawinul ably mans the piano, and Sam Jones is on bass.  Roy McCurdy is on drums with the quintet, and Louis Hayes is on drums with the sextet.<br />I especially liked the quintet's romping version of \"Fiddler on The Roof.\"<br />There is also one quartet number with Cannon and the rhythm section playing a lovely version of \"Stars Fell on Alabama.\"<br />The sound is as expected on a radio broadcast.  And you have to expect some numbers ending abruptly before the group has finished, presumably to align with the air time of a radio station.<br />I found this recording in a cut out bin for a couple of bucks.  It was a good investment.  This same recording is also available released by a different label.  You can find reviews of it on Amazon.

When I am reading reviews I often make sure to sort by \"most recent\" as sometimes recipes, formulas, or other pertinent info changes.<br /><br /> I am truly pleased with this Hereford product. It has a natural taste, smells good, and it tastes fine direct from pouch or heated up (my picture is of a portion of the pouch-- maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of contents). Appears like a thin block of meat at first, but it totally becomes a nice bowl of juicy shreds once heated. Not too salty, just enough to make it tasty direct from pouch. Do what you want with it. I tried it with crackers.<br /><br />Great option for those that dont have time or interest to cook beef. Or want smaller portion sizes to work from. Shelf stable until opened, so that further lends to the convenience. Also good for those that want the beef but not the gravy.  I really can't see any need for improvement. Not sure what else can be done (still thinking about some of the comments). It is only shredded beef, some broth (just a little, you are paying for beef here, yay!), and some salt.<br /><br />Are you a prepper (proactive and ready for sudden food needs?) Super amazing for stacking up food for emergencies, mega inflation, shortages and such. Adds variety (only so much chicken and tuna one can eat), and it makes it easy. Dont even need a can opener. Can be shared with furry family members in a pinch too.<br /><br />I would add this to my hiking bag for sure.

Grace was a lot to take sometimes especially about middle to the end.  She's fiercely independent and had to be because she takes care of her very ill mother.  She had nobody but herself to depend on so its understandable how she's untrustworthy and wary to solidify the mating with Kozav.  She doesnt doubt the Knowing with him and that they are mates.  She knows it and even accepts it.  She just takes awhile to be ready for it all.  Her mothers health is a big stress for her and the Preor healers are really good at getting her better.

I don't even know what the blurb for this book is at this point... I've read them all back to back and haven't bothered with blurbs. The books have been so alluring, it didn't matter the story, I knew I wanted to read them and come into the world of the Rogue Protectors.<br /><br />Overall, a great story! But. Yes, there's a but on this one... This book had a couple of things that made me cringe a little.<br />For one, the pregnancy timeline didn't always add up. When she found out she was pregnant, she was saying she was only two weeks pregnant. But, anyone who has been pregnant should know they typically use your last cycle as the date. So by the time she tested on the day she was due, or the next day (I can't remember which it was) she would be 4 weeks by default of her cycle (there was nothing to indicate she's irregular and in fact it sounded like she was regular which is why she tested when she did. So there's that. And then a couple weeks later she goes to see the spook doctor in the non descript building who put her appropriately around 6 weeks. But then a chapter later or so, Nadia was saying she was 5 weeks. So yeah. The timeline was a bit odd/off for me. If I had never been pregnant before, it may not have even phased me. But having been pregnant twice and having a child, it made me cringe.<br />The second \"blunder\" to me was when Nadia was unconscious in the hospital and John was there dealing with doctors and such and the book said Nadia thought the other guy was a doctor... Except she was allegedly unconscious at that point so that didn't make sense.<br />The only other \"negative\" feedback would be referring to all the people. Having read all the books, and knowing who was around, I followed the story for the most part (sometimes even I didn't know which spy they were talking about. Haha). But referring to Andrade as \"the businessman\" and \"the billionaire\" in the book made me have to think of who is the businessman? Because they were also talking about Migs and Roarke and Levi and the MoMoS (I loved them!!). So name clarification at times, instead of \"roles\" (i.e., spy, businessman, etc.) would have been a bit easier to follow at times.<br /><br />Ok, but back to John and Nadia. I loved how possessive he was with her and how he kept everything so nonchalant when he was abducted. Though I was a bit disappointed that Nadia didn't give him a thorough exam after finding out he was abducted so she could kiss his bruises and make him better. Hehe.<br /><br />The MoMoS were amazing as well! Seriously, those guys rocked! I loved all of them! They made the story that much better. And then the Scot kicking butt and taking names?! Yes, please! His new romance with Fiona (John's mom) was adorable too. I'd have liked to see that more solid in the epilogue too.<br /><br />John bring a spook definitely created challenges for his personal life, but it was lovely to see how Nadia pulled him out of that a bit and into the world of having it all - family, friends as family, and love.<br /><br />Seriously, I'm not sure why you're reading this review.

I had been considering buying a new belt style retractable leash after getting a rope burn on my leg about a month ago so this was the perfect opportunity to replace and I'm very happy with the choice.  The lock button is bigger, which actually makes it a little harder to use, but it isn't really a big deal.

I've had no problems with this leash and it's holding up beautifully against drops and use on the beach.  I haven't had any tangles, or burns from the leash.

I have always keep up to latest releases (to a reasonable extent).  I use: Quicken, Quickbooks, Personal Lawyer, Business Lawyer and Quickbooks (mostly for Payroll).  Several hundred dollars a year.<br />The first grip I have with Intuit's products is everytime I install or upgrade one of their products I have to spend 5 or 10 minutes cleaning their \"additional\" icons splatted on my desktop.  You always get their own Promotional Icons and \"Try AOL\" icon.  You do not have an option to stop this from happening.  I hate a cluttered desktop and I hate anyone who presumes to install software on my computer thats is not part of what I am intending to do.  Now they are installing Spyware with TurboTax--HOW DARE THEY!!!<br />Now for the reason I called TurboTax \"Rent-a-Use\" software.<br />I installed TurboTax Deluxe and had to activiate it on this computer.  I did not realize that the activation was controlled thru spyware using up my computer resources.  You cannot remove the spyware because TurboTax will not work anymore.  Not a problem I thought, as soon I finish with TurboTax I will de-install the software and everything will be fine. Ha.<br />I then used the State Download Wizard to get my \"free\" state version that comes with the Deluxe version.  First I had to give them my Credit Card and it was charged [$$] which I have to send in a rebate from and wait 6 weeks to get my money back (assuming it does not get lost).  I was concerned that it would not allow be to save the State software to a backup file.  I would need it later if I had to re-file, bought a new computer or just de-installed TurboTax.  I contacted Customer support and basically I was told if I thought I might need later I should not de-install it.  BECAUSE IF I DID I WOULD HAVE TO PAY AGAIN TO RE-ACTIVATE AT THE FULL PURCHASE PRICE.  Anger is not the word I would use to describe how I felt.  I cannot believe that I can only rent their software. Its obvious I do not own it.<br />How long will it be before all their software is like this?<br />Time to change:<br />Quicken  = Microsoft Money<br />TurboTax  = TaxCut (had a better writeup)<br />Quickbooks = for payroll only, I still looking--any suggestions?<br />By the way Intuit charges an annual fee for keeping the Payroll taxes up to date ([$$]).  My subscription ran out in [date].<br />No problem, there were not any tax changes to worry about in that time frame, so I decide to wait until there were.  Why pay for a subscription when there is any thing to update?.  I proceeded to run January's payroll on [date] and Quickbook does more than just warn you that your Tax Tables may be out-of-date--it no longer works correctly and this it does not warn you about.  It did not calulate my State Tax as a deduction.  I caught it, but I could have faced penalities from the State had I not pay them in time.<br />We have to stop Software manufacturers from doing things like this.  They have a right to protect theirselves against pirates, but we have rights too.  First we have Microsoft with their \"registered computer\" Office XP and now we have this incidious spyware \"rent-a-use\" software from Intuit.<br />Recommendation: Don't buy or upgrade any of Intuit's products.<br />Spend your money on better software.

Here's why...first off, I wasn't even able to fully update the Supermarket, like getting the camera, tv, and some other items because they were only available by using diamonds versus coins.  So instead updated the mop, carts, shelves, got the security guard and the cashier.  Basically anything that didn't require diamonds.  The cashier was about 75 diamonds and after I got that I was basically low on diamonds.  Up to that point I was actually really enjoying the game as it really is fun to play.  I would play the Casino daily but only got diamonds one time and it was a paltry amount.  Despite that I still liked it and figured I would just build up diamonds over time during gameplay.  Then, I got to the Garden Center.  Instead of the cashier and the security guard carrying over you have to reaquire them.  Okay, makes sense, as it's a whole other store.  So I go to get them and was able to get the security guard using coins but the cashier required 100 diamonds.  Tried to update the number of shopping carts, diamonds required.  Tried to play without  necessary updates that I was able to make using coins in the Supermarket, diamonds now required so I couldn't get anywhere and just gave up. That was it for me.  I wasn't about to spend actual money.  If the game allowed you to get either more diamonds through gameplay, at the casino, or decreased the amount needed then I would have continued.  However, seeing that I couldn't update the store at the Supermarket the way I wanted without having to spend real money what's the point.  I would clearly have to wait a long time, probably replay the earlier levels numerous time's for coins to try my hand at the Casino (won't hold my breath).  So yeah, I see where this is going and I'm done. Now that being said for those willing to shell out real money I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself.  The graphics are great, I liked how the game itself was setup, like the characters and overall gameplay.  Definitely a great time management game as countless others have already stated.
