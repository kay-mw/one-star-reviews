Because it's a squat little bottle, and it has the hour-glass figure shape to it as well as the incredibly large nipple, we have to tip it (or her) at the oddest angle in order to get the last ounce or so.

It centers around a creative youngster named Duncan, who solves his crayons' complaints by thinking &quot;outside of the BOX&quot; (pun intended!), and our two older grandsons both enjoy reading it to their younger brother.  In this book, that box happens to be full of crayons who don't actually quit, but do have a list of grievances they present to their owner, who comes up with a very inventive solution to get the result HE wants (to be able to color with crayons who are in agreeable moods!) by providing them what THEY need (to be used in more ways than their shades would stereotypically be used for.)  The letters the crayons have written to their owner are hilarious, and having each separate letter written on the left side of the spread in a child's handwriting, with the right side showing a child-like drawing of objects that shade is typically used to color, is a sure-fire way to immediately draw a youngster in.  Nice collaborative effort by author and illustrator!<br /><br />Our older grandsons have a lot of fun voicing the letters written by &quot;Red&quot;, who even has to work on holidays (i.e. coloring Santas, Valentines), &quot;Purple&quot; is going to &quot;completely lose it&quot; if Duncan doesn't start coloring inside of the lines soon, &quot;Beige&quot; (who is &quot;BEIGE and PROUD!&quot;) is jealous of &quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;Gray&quot; is tired of getting all of the BIG jobs (like coloring elephants, rhinos, hippos and HUMPBACK WHALES), &quot;White&quot; is feeling underutilized, &quot;Black&quot; doesn't find it fair that he's only used as an outline to brightly colored objects, &quot;Green&quot; is a peacemaker type (or a tattle tale, depending upon your outlook!), who claims to be very happy with his work, congratulates Duncan on his coloring career, but wants to inform him of the bickering between &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Orange&quot; over who gets to be the color of the sun, with &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Orange&quot; writing separate letters each stating their case along with documented proof, &quot;Blue&quot; is overworked and now just a stub who can't even see over the box railing any longer, &quot;Pink&quot; believes she's experiencing discrimination because she's &quot;a girls' color&quot;, while &quot;Peach&quot; is completely unwrapped (&quot;I don't even have any underwear!&quot;) and embarrassed to leave the box.  Wow - what a conundrum!  But the amazingly colorful picture Duncan creates - allowing each crayon to stretch beyond their typical usages - ends up earning him an A for coloring and an A+ for creativity!<br /><br />Speaking both as a mom and now a grandma, I've come to believe that one of the most important things an adult can do for their children/grandchildren is to strongly encourage them to be creative and use their imaginations.  Whether he/she eventually becomes an astrophysicist, a police officer, a stay-at-home mom or dad, etc., EVERY occupation requires the use of those mental tools when called upon to problem-solve and come up with solutions.  How many bosses out there couldn't learn a thing or two from Duncan?

This is a level 1 reading book, more advanced for a 4-5 yr old who is beginning to read.

Her brother was reading to first graders when he was 4 so it seems to be working out thus far. The big type and simple words repeated over and over again in the story are educational.

Berry, this time in a '68 Mercury. Uncharacteristicly, our tour guide lets the fuel gauge drop dangerously close to \"E\", but he completes the journey with time to spare.<br />There are 16 tracks, three of which appear to be \"previously unreleased\" to this reviewer, namely \"Misery\" (uptempo - sounds like a new vocal track over a previously used music bed), \"Almost Grown\" (recut!), \"Campus Cookie\" (creative instrumental), and \"Song Of My Love\" (Latinesque duet). One track, the blues \"Laugh And Cry\", apears to be formerly B-side only.<br />Four bonus tracks should appeal to the fan-collector.<br />\"Ma Dear\" has some of the \"Down In The Valley\" feel, a la Solomon Burke; more of the feel of \"Something You Got\" by Chris Kenner. A good track, well placed as track #2. Track #4 is something nice for the deep fan-musician, 5:55 of \"I Love Her, I Love Her\", out of the blues-progression, a interesting little Rock and Roll soap opera, sensitively sung by Chuck. Needless to say, his guitar work is sensational.<br />#13 is something that takes a little study: sounds like someone decided to overlap two different songs, believing that if they're in the same key and pitch, and in sync rhythmically, it would work for the hippie contingent. Well, I played it through my computer which favored the left channel and I heard a great number. Sounds like they took the backing track for \"Club Nitty Gritty\", pumped up the drums, and Berry did his thing. It's a football scene, with fun lyrics and a bright vocal. (Guess I'll go back to my CD deck and isolate the *right* side. Yo! do we have *seventeen* songs?!).<br />The more critical fan will want to separate the more familiar taste treats from the new exotic ones at the few highway stop-offs for pop and refreshments.<br />Yeah, it was '68, still a good year for the 8-cylinder.

If you are looking for the best Indian music out there, this is probably not for you.  The artists are competent, but cannot really be compared to the late Ravi Shankar or Ali Akbar Khan.  Furthermore, the 1950's technology does not make a record that knocks your socks off.  But if you approach this recording in this manner, I fear that you will be missing a lot.<br /><br />There are really only a a small handful of recordings of Indian classical music produced in the West during the 1950s.  Some like the Angel records release of Ali Akbar Khan's Music of India: Morning and Evening Ragas (1955), or Ravi Shankar's Three Ragas (1956) are viewed as classics. But albums like this do not give a complete picture of the emergence of this genre in the West.<br /><br />During the 1950s and 1960s the marketing classification of &#34;World Music&#34; did not exist.  Record companies were just beginning to experiment with the distribution of classical Indian musicians.  But both the music companies as well as the public did not really know what to think of this.  Were they ethnomusicological recordings?  Were they music that was just for the Beat / Hippie crowd?  There were no answers, so every release was a marketing test.<br /><br />This recording is a valuable insight into this environment.  The record cover went into extensive detail as to the music and instruments.  This is something that is never done today.  Musicians like Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan went to extreme lengths to &#34;blow you away&#34; with their technical virtuosity.  In the process, basic musical structures and concepts were often obscured to all except the most well trained of listeners.  This recording on the other hand, was cleaner and illustrated basic concepts of raga and tala much more clearly.  I feel that it showed the basic structure of an Indian performance much more clearly than many other recording of the period.<br /><br />I for one, was deeply influenced by this recording.  I suspect that many other were too.  As is often the case the most influential musicians are often not the most famous.<br /><br />So the bottom line is clear.  If you have a particular interest in the early development of the marketing concept of World Music, I recommend that you find a copy of this recording (if you can find one).", "review_title": "not an easy answer.", "timestamp": 1388078011000}, {"product_title": "Potpourri of Bluegrass Jam", "rating": 5.0, "review_text": "Great assembly of musicians.

So the author took some liberties, which is OK since this not a history text. However I understand the disappointment expressed by some other reviewers... to a certain point.<br /><br />If every book about 20th century history was lost with exception of this one, the image of what happened between 1961 and 1989 would be fairly incomplete as the author focused almost exclusively on lesser known facts.<br />This is not intended to be seen as a criticism of mine. Again: This is not a history book, but a work of historical fiction. There is ample narration about the Kennedys and the civil rights movement in the U.S. and the life in Eastern Germany and Russia, but very little about other important things that happened outside that but changed world history. Very little mention and no narration is made about the space program, the Man on the Moon, and Lyndon Johnson's \"Great Society\" project; the conflicts in the Middle East and the energy crisis. However the music scene of that time gets ample coverage; also later on the lesser known background facts around the collapse of the Soviet Block.<br />Somehow the proportion seems odd: a huge percentage of the work covers the Kennedy era, second to that comes Nixon, and then the plot jumps almost right into the collapse of the Soviet Union and the East Block, leaving some funny gaps in between.<br /><br />The action itself is mostly described in fictional conversations between the main characters of this novel, which can become somewhat bore-some at times, and take life away from the plot, occasionally even from the characters themselves. And, without being prudish: IMHO one could live very well with only half of the sex descriptions, which moreover leave the impression of being puberty phantasies rather than real life. But overall: This book is well written, and can be classified as a page turner!<br /><br />This third tome of what was meant as a 20th Century trilogy covers historical events and characters which are in our most recent past and about which there still are strong, sometimes hard personal feelings out in the readership.<br />This is understandable, also the fact that we might agree or disagree with some of the points of view the author wants to express through the fictional characters in this novel.<br />However, a product review is not the place to ventilate those feelings criticizing the author's alleged political, personal or national views... which, again to be said, are expressed by the fictional characters inside their time and environment; not by the author himself.", "review_title": "Third book of a great trilogy", "timestamp": 1416010860000}, {"product_title": "Gone (Gone Series Book 1)", "rating": 3.0, "review_text": "Good mystery, but the ending left you hanging.

I binge-read The Connection in a day and a half and have already recommended it to a few family members both YA-aged and those like myself who love the genre many years later.<br /><br />The Connection is very reminiscent of a lot of the YA supernatural/dystopian/romance series that have risen to popularity - the dynamic between the main characters serves up major Roswell/Divergent/Twilight vibes (in the best of ways). Naturally, I ate it right up. It is angsty and full of all of the teenage feels that make reading a book like this such an awesome escape from reality.<br /><br />I\u2019m a sucker for dual-perspective novels and feel like the alternating POV really lends a hand to the fast-paced nature of this book and to the development of the main characters, Bea and Cash, whose enemies-to-lovers romance is at the core of this novel. Bea\u2019s life is turned upside down when family secrets come to life and she learns of an otherworldly connection to an alien race. She is so much more than a foolish high schooler, which I loved, and she really gives the cocky Cash a run for his money as the two butt heads while he tries to keep her safe to save their respective planets.<br /><br />Aside from the main characters, the secondary characters are also fleshed out in a way that allows the reader to really place themselves within the universe of this book. I didn\u2019t feel like Darla, Tasha and co were sidelined or one-dimensional in the telling of this story.<br /><br />This novel is a sci-fi YA romance, however, it is light on the science fiction aspect, which I actually appreciated.

I appreciate that it turns on silently (the Casio would forward some of the paper roll every time it was turned on, even in no-print mode, and it was the paper-moving mechanism that eventually failed and provided a permanent error in the display).
