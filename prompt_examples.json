I wasn't sure what to expect and was really happily surprised. Here are the pros and cons:<br /><br />1. I have had two leaks so far only and that was after prolonged use during the evenings only. I do not normally switch to night time diapers so this has also happened with other brands (to include huggies, honest etc). Those two leaks were a result of very very full diapers the next morning especially since my child still breastfeeds at night. During the day I have not noticed any leaks at all.<br />2. I find the design much better than Honest. For some reason they fit better and have more flexibility. Other brands tend to feel less fitted and more boxy if that makes sense.<br />3. I don't mind the color of these. However, someone did come over and state &#34;Are these diapers dirty?&#34; and I was puzzled until they pointed out that the color (which is not due to dirty diapers but due to their design) was just a little strange to them. I personally didn't mind this but thought I'd include it since it was part of my observation when using these diapers.<br /><br />The price is up there with Honest in my opinion (at least where I shop which is typically Target). Usually not your cheapest so this is a con. However, I tested these when they were on clearance so they were thus comparable to a few other brands. This might not be the case typically though so I'd also like to make this clear.", "review_title": "Color might seem strange, better fit, few leaks unless used as a night time diaper in some instances", "timestamp": 1460687285000}, {"product_title": "EVERYDAY KIDS Llama Llama 4 Pc Toddler Bedding Set with Comforter, Flat Sheet, Fitted Sheet and Pillowcase Bright Blue Toddler Bed Set Features Llama Llama and Friends", "rating": 4.0, "review_text": "Bought this for my daughter, who loves mermaids and has red hair, and she loves it!

It's zipper's slider head and pull tab are metal (good!), but its chain is plastic (less durable than metal).<br /><br />How well does it insulate? Nobody likes to discard formula or breast milk because it stayed warm for too long, so I took some objective measurements of bottle temperature over time. I compared Dr. Brown's bag with the cheap, free zipper bag that we got for free from the hospital.<br /><br />For my test, no ice pack was used to simulate cases where the pack has melted, and insulation is most important.<br />Both bottles were chilled to 40F (4.4C). The temperature was logged in real-time using a Weber thermometer with new probes.<br />PROBE1 is the Dr. Brown's tote; PROBE2 is the generic tote you see on the right.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: The Dr. Brown's tote insulates no better than the generic tote. The generic tote uses closed-cell foam (based on how it feels--I didn't cut it open) whereas the Dr. Brown's tote uses neoprene, which is more durable but feels thinner. The neoprene, if unlined, also allows moisture through. This probably reduces condensation build-up, but may not insulate quite as well.<br /><br />Please note that the hospital bag is somewhat smaller, so there is less surface area to lose heat. A more formal scientific test would have also held the probes at the center of the bottle, which I could not do. Finally, the Weber iGrill is not a high-precision instrument; it is meant for grills where a degree or two makes little difference, and where temperatures tend to be high. In other words, this is not a completely fair comparison, but it should be close enough. The readings are also helpful for bottle life estimation.", "review_title": "Well-made, but could insulate better", "timestamp": 1497202309965}, {"product_title": "HABA Color Fun Play Gym - Wooden Activity Center with Adjustable Height, Sliding Discs and Dangling Frog", "rating": 4.0, "review_text": "I love that this is easy to disassemble and store flat.

It also stained my bathroom sink, and I can't get the stain out, even with a bleach-containing cleaner. So now, I'm careful to put it on a cotton pad and not let it leak onto the sink. A similar, slightly more expensive, product to consider is Melixer Vegan Balancing Toner with Organic Green Tea Extract, that you can get on Amazon as well.

I have cable TV and I purchased a Roku 3 so I could easily transfer Netflix and Amazon prime movies to my TV. All I needed in addition to the Roku was a router, which I fortunately already had.<br /><br />From the time I opened the box, the Roku was up and running in about ten minutes. Knowing what I know now (from my son), I would be able to set up a similar device in 5 minutes or less. After my son explained the simple remote to me, I was on Amazon Prime searching for movies as if I had been doing it for years - thanks Amazon! My major concern was how my wife would like it. Sometimes she seems to think remotes have it out for her. When she got home, I explained the remote, and she had it mastered in less than a minute.<br /><br />My Samsung 52\" TV is playing crystal clear Amazon Prime movies. I cannot imagine how Roku or anyone else could make this device easier to set up and operate with a system similar to mine.<br /><br />If you decide to purchase a Roku 3 from Amazon, and Tiger Direct is your vendor, be prepared for delays and confusion. When mine didn't arrive on time, I contacted Tiger and got confusing and nonsensical responses for three weeks while my Roku was on \"backorder\". While mine was on backorder, Tiger was still advertising the Roku on Amazon as \"In Stock\" and \"Next Day Delivery Available\". They responded to my inquiries but the responses made no sense, kind of like one of those phishing e-mails you get from a foreign country where the syntax is all wrong.

It went in a completely different direction than I thought it would, and that was a nice surprise. I won't say I was always happy about where it went, but in the end, I completely agree with the journey.<br /><br />This book is much more about action than about the romance. There is still lots of romance, but I'm not going to discuss that because I don't want to give anything away. What I will talk about is the fact that the SCI continues in their evil ways, but finally someone is standing up to them. The book is on a global scale...even more since the events of this book directly affect every person on Earth and Thera. And we learn more about these mysterious Arbiters, who are finally getting involved in the conflict. We have some amazing character development on Kira, Ethan, Jax, Blake, and we get some major involvement from the Clean Slate Complex characters Alexa and Joshua. This book jumps all around in time with flashbacks and the like so it covers a huge amount of ground. There are also a number of mysteries interwoven into the story and quite a few bits of mythology and meaning behind the world of Thera.<br /><br />If you read Daynight, will you like this one? I think it depends on what you read Daynight for, and what you got out of it. I will say for myself, I love this book. It is Daynight amplified. It is action, romance, and mystery.

They glide on the paper smoothly and blend extremely well. There is a slight graininess to the watercolors after they dry if thin out with water but for someone who likes visual texture, esspecially with my landscape paintings, it's not an issue. Overall, they are a good quality for the affordable price and would be perfect for beginner to intermediate watercolor artists.<br /><br />BRUSH: The brush doesn't have a size, but when compared to my other brushes, it seems to be about a size 2. The bristles have kept their shape through multiple uses and I haven't had any issues with shedding so far. My go to brush is a size 4, so this is smaller than I prefer but I could see using for smaller details.<br /><br />SWATCH SHEET: I like to reference my swatch sheet a lot when I paint, so I was excited to see this included in the set. After looking at it, I noticed that the swatches did not line up with the watercolors in the tin. It take more time and a little frustration to have to search for the color instead of just looking down from the swatch to the watercolor. I see why they did it that way so their company name would be on the sheet, but I would recommend changing the swatch sheet to line up exactly with the watercolor rows and making the company name smaller - more out of the way. I will be making my own swatch sheet so it lines up more accurately with all the watercolor pan rows.<br /><br />WATER BRUSH PEN: I've never used a water brush before, but I do like this water brush pen because it is easy to fill, the seal stays tight so I haven't had any issues with the water leaking out, and the button to release the water is easy to push to adjust the flow. It does bubble up a bit when pushed multiple times in a short period but I think it's just something I have to learn better. It feels good in my hand and will be great for on the go painting where I don't have access to water as easily. I'd love to see this brush come in other shapes and sizes in the future.<br /><br />PENCIL AND ERASER: These are decent basic drawing tools which I start most of my watercolor painting with. They do a good job with my preliminary sketching.<br /><br />SPONGE: I'm not exactly sure what the sponge is used for other than pushing out the excess water and color from the water brush pen. It soaks up the water very quickly though, so I've had to continually wring it out. I'd like to see a thicker sponge that will take more water changes.<br /><br />PAPER: I wasn't a fan of the included watercolor paper. The paper has a very beginner quality to it compared to the paper I currently use, but I'm used to using a more expensive paper. The texture is a bit much and the more an area is painted on, the texture goes away leaving a smooth spot. The paper also warps pretty quickly, even with the edges taped down. My biggest issue with the paper was that it is advertised as size 5\"x8\" but when measured, it's actually 4 3/4\"x8 1/4\" so I can't get a true 5\"x7\" piece out of it.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this set to any beginner or intermediate watercolor artist, especially for the price.
