If you wish not to view IEF reviews such as this, click on the filter link to the right of the review section, and then click on \"verified purchases only\"; that will take most of them out.<br /><br /> I actually did not buy this for its intended purpose. When I first saw the opportunity to get this at a discount, what I thought of was unusual. My boyfriend has a little dog that likes to sleep on the dashboard when he's driving. I know this is not safe and all that,  but I also know that he insists on spoiling her and letting her do this, and not hooking her up to a leash in the car \u2013 and she does seem to stay in position while he's driving. He has to hold onto her butt  if he makes a sharp turn, which is distracting to him. So I decided that if he is going to do this anyway, I would get him a grip mat for the dashboard to allow her to stay put a little easier.  This mat seems to work great for that purpose, it has a rubberized bottom (which I show in my photo; the product is upside-down) to stick to the dashboard.  Plus, the furry plush  surface will allow her to grip with her a little claws on the turns.  So far, that works great and I'm loving this. I really can't comment on how it works for keyboards or carpal tunnel syndrome.  It has minimal padding inside, and I always thought people with carpal tunnel syndrome feel more comfortable with their wrists raised into a resting position (having worked in hand surgery myself on CTS cases in the past).

I like taking this when I've had a couple of rough nights in a row and have had trouble falling asleep. It really does work. It's better than using the capsules as the liquid is absorbed faster. The taste is okay; nothing like DayQuil or NyQuil that makes you cringe. But it's not delicious or anything either. The directions say to take 30ml before bed for adults, but I personally think that's too much for me. If I take 30ml, I wake up feeling almost hungover with no energy. Half of that dosage usually works for me. But I suppose it depends on your body. Also, you can't take this if you've been tossing and turning and it's already the middle of the night. You have to give yourself at least 8 hours for it to wear off so you're not still feeling it when you wake up. That's a mistake a lot of people make.

The original valve had 200,000 miles on it and was no longer fully sealing (you could feel just a bit of vacuum being pulled through it even when it was closed).  I bought a Motorcraft valve thinking it would be the most reliable option.<br /><br />I installed this valve but would still occasionally get a code for high evap flow.  I checked the valve and vacuum lines repeatedly but saw no leaks, and every time I checked the valve it was fully sealed.<br /><br />I didn't know it but the valve was intermittently sticking open.  The purge flow sensor would detect it and set a code, but the valve would close up again and act normal after a few minutes.  By the time I checked, it would be fine.  This drove me nuts.<br /><br />One day the truck set the code again and I felt it stumbling and misfiring at idle.  This time the valve was stuck wide open but didn't close in it's own.  I tapped on it a few times and it snapped shut and the truck's idle evened out.<br /><br />I connected my scan tool and cycled the valve using the bidirectional test mode.  It would always open when power was applied but intermittently fail to close when power was removed.  Sometimes I had to tap on it to get it to shut.<br /><br />I tried cleaning it a couple of times, thinking that some manufacturing debris had been left in it.  Finally I ran some rubbing alcohol through it and cycled it quickly by grounding one terminal with a test light.  That seemed to do the trick, though I'm still not 100% convinced it will continue to work.<br /><br />The only thing upstream of this valve is the charcoal canister. I checked to make sure it wasn't shedding bits of charcoal that could have caused the valve to stick open.  I couldn't find any, and I've never seen evidence of any debris in the valve, the lines, or the purge flow sensor.  I think I just got a bad valve.  I didn't find it in time to return it, so I'll live with it.<br /><br />I can probably just chalk this up to luck of the draw.  Bad parts just happen sometimes, though I did expect better by paying a premium for an original Motorcraft part.

Uncharacteristicly, our tour guide lets the fuel gauge drop dangerously close to \"E\", but he completes the journey with time to spare.<br />There are 16 tracks, three of which appear to be \"previously unreleased\" to this reviewer, namely \"Misery\" (uptempo - sounds like a new vocal track over a previously used music bed), \"Almost Grown\" (recut!), \"Campus Cookie\" (creative instrumental), and \"Song Of My Love\" (Latinesque duet). One track, the blues \"Laugh And Cry\", apears to be formerly B-side only.<br />Four bonus tracks should appeal to the fan-collector.<br />\"Ma Dear\" has some of the \"Down In The Valley\" feel, a la Solomon Burke; more of the feel of \"Something You Got\" by Chris Kenner. A good track, well placed as track #2. Track #4 is something nice for the deep fan-musician, 5:55 of \"I Love Her, I Love Her\", out of the blues-progression, a interesting little Rock and Roll soap opera, sensitively sung by Chuck. Needless to say, his guitar work is sensational.<br />#13 is something that takes a little study: sounds like someone decided to overlap two different songs, believing that if they're in the same key and pitch, and in sync rhythmically, it would work for the hippie contingent. Well, I played it through my computer which favored the left channel and I heard a great number.

I rarely give 5-star reviews, but this one is definitely 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Features we LOVE and WHY:<br />==========================<br />1. Temperature sensor and low/high alert ranges.  We set the \"high temperature alert\" to 78 (I think you can set it as high as 84), because when the baby's room is 78 degrees it feels pretty warm.  The reason I take off 1/2 star is because of the maximum low temperature setting, which is 66.  That's right, the maximum you can set the \"low temperature alert\" is 66.  Well, if our baby's room is 70degrees it's pretty dang cold in there.  In winter, it might drop to 68 and that's really cold in her small room.  Honestly, if we could set the \"low temp alert\" to 70, then I'd give this 5 stars as it would be a perfect device.<br /><br />2. Humidity sensor.  This is our first baby and we are probably being overcautious, but hey this was on our baby registry and we are super glad we have this.  You're supposed to keep a baby's room between 40% and 60% humidity.  In winter, the room can drop to a fairly dry 18% and even in humid summers, it may only reach 38%.  This device is our litmus test that our room humidifier still works...and it works great.  The humidifier can bring a dry 18% humidity room to at least 38-44% and raise a summer room to 55% humidity or more.  Our baby sleeps 8-12 hours a night (since 12 weeks old) and cradle cap is minimal and perhaps it helps keep her eczema at bay.  She hasn't gotten sick and wakes up happy and laughing.  I dunno if it is because of the humidity level, but hey, as first-time parents, we're happy she's happy.<br /><br />3. DECT wireless signal.  This is a very important feature and should be the deciding factor in choosing something cheaper or not; you should always get DECT if you have wireless Internet.  My wife and I both work from home a few days a week.  We also got a wireless video baby monitor on our baby registry, but had to return it due to interference problems.  You see, essentially every wireless *video* monitor I've researched (from Summer brand to even Philips) will transmit over 2.4ghz.  2.4ghz is the same as most in-home cordless phones and WIFI / wireless devices.  As of this writing, ALL wireless IP protocols transmit at 2.4ghz, with the newest protocols like 802.11g and 802.11n transmitting at 2.4ghz and 5.0ghz.  Unless your laptop is brand new, you likely do not have built-in wireless that transmits at only 5.0ghz.  I know for a fact that my smartphone will only transmit WIFI at 2.4ghz as well as my wife's netbook.<br /><br />WHAT DOES THAT ALL MEAN?!??<br /><br />It means that when I run an Internet speed test with my laptop (sitting here at home), with no *video* baby monitor plugged in, I get the full 23-25mbs download speeds I am supposed to get.  This is because there is no interference.  If I plug in a *video* baby monitor, my Internet speed immediately drops to 8-12mbs and the WIFI on my smartphone will sometimes lock up while trying to re-transmit.  Overall speed is slow.  If you use VOIP (voice over IP) like Skype or Tango and such, you will fade in and out and likely not be audible.  The reason is because the *video* baby monitor is transmitting at 2.4ghz and causing interference.  Even choosing specific wireless channels on my Internet router is not helpful, because most *video* monitors do not allow you to choose a specific channel - rather, they jump to whichever channel it thinks is open.<br /><br />UHM, LET'S GET BACK TO WHAT DECT IS, GOOD OR BAD?!??<br /><br />DECT is a blessing!  DECT is wireless that transmits at 1.9ghz.  Meaning, it doesn't interfere with your wireless Internet or cordless phone at all.  It means I can freely work from home and have no issues with Internet speed at all and perfect VOIP calls.<br /><br />WHY DO YOU KEEP BRINGING UP *VIDEO* BABY MONITORS??<br /><br />This product is audio only and transmits with DECT.  I have not found any video baby monitor that specifically transmits with DECT.  I wanted to bring that up to show the importance of why you should always choose DECT.  (Leave a comment if you want to know how I did get interference free *video* monitoring for cheap)<br /><br />Battery Life:<br />==============<br />For our specific home, it's an open-floor style 2-story, so by turning down the sensitivity and using eco-mode, we can get a full week of battery life on the parent unit! The first day we got maybe 24 hours, but once I tweaked the sensitivity to our liking and turned on eco-mode, wow, a week of usage.  Also, there's no worry about forgetting to recharge it, when the battery is low, it will beep every 5 seconds and flash \"Battery Low\" until you put it on the charger.<br /><br />The baby unit (the part that you leave in the baby's room) takes four AA-batteries as battery BACKUP, which is great, because sometimes we might have the baby in a different room and without having to move the crib and unplug the power adapter, we can just unplug the cord and use battery power.  You can probably go 4-5 days on nothing but AA battery power, as we have done on occasion.<br /><br />Volume:<br />=========<br />We are very happy with the volume and it is a smart-volume.  I thought the built-in Lullabies would actually turn the audio monitoring on, well if you've adjusted the sensitivity, the audio monitor won't turn on until the baby is actually crying.  And when our baby cries, she cries.  If she is just cooing and moving around and we don't hear that, oh well, we're enjoying our sleep.  The LED lights also light up based on how loud she is crying, too.<br /><br />Walkie-Talkie and paging function:<br />=====================================<br />On the side is a push to talk function, which my wife and I have used a number of times for \"can you go warm up some more milk?\" or \"I dropped the pacifier, can you bring up a clean one?\"  If you lose the parent unit, you can press the paging button on the baby unit and the parent unit will beep.  (Or to get the attention of your significant other ;--)  )<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />==========<br />Love this device.  We wanted it mainly for the temperature and humidity monitoring and audible threshold alerts first.  Second, was for the audio for when she cries.  We used this even when she was in a bassinett in the same room the first night home to monitor the temp and humidity.  We love this device for the peace of mind and it is almost a 5 star device.<br /><br />Most recently (which compelled me to write this review), we had put her to bed by 7:30pm and noticed the temp not lowering.  (The baby room is upstairs and the master bedroom is down; 2 separate A/C units)  I checked the Upstairs Thermostat and it was powered and I checked the breakers and they were not tripped (as what usually happens in past experience).  The thermostat showed the A/C was running and I went outside and the upstairs unit had it's fans going strong, all indications that everything at least was running.  A little while later, the parent unit is beeping because it reached 78deg in her room, which is very very unusual for the evening.  Her room actually 'felt' fine, but the Avent told us otherwise.  I didn't feel any airflow from the vents.  We let her sleep downstairs with us that night and the next morning the A/C guy diagnosed a burnt-out capacitor that kept the blower motor from pushing any of the air.  Had we not had the Avent with temperature alert set, we might not have ever known her room was getting hot.  We live in Dallas where it can still be 99degrees at midnight and heat rises to the upstairs...

It went in a completely different direction than I thought it would, and that was a nice surprise.

There is still lots of romance, but I'm not going to discuss that because I don't want to give anything away. What I will talk about is the fact that the SCI continues in their evil ways, but finally someone is standing up to them. The book is on a global scale...even more since the events of this book directly affect every person on Earth and Thera. And we learn more about these mysterious Arbiters, who are finally getting involved in the conflict. We have some amazing character development on Kira, Ethan, Jax, Blake, and we get some major involvement from the Clean Slate Complex characters Alexa and Joshua. This book jumps all around in time with flashbacks and the like so it covers a huge amount of ground. There are also a number of mysteries interwoven into the story and quite a few bits of mythology and meaning behind the world of Thera.<br /><br />If you read Daynight, will you like this one?

So the author took some liberties, which is OK since this not a history text. However I understand the disappointment expressed by some other reviewers... to a certain point.<br /><br />If every book about 20th century history was lost with exception of this one, the image of what happened between 1961 and 1989 would be fairly incomplete as the author focused almost exclusively on lesser known facts.<br />This is not intended to be seen as a criticism of mine. Again: This is not a history book, but a work of historical fiction. There is ample narration about the Kennedys and the civil rights movement in the U.S. and the life in Eastern Germany and Russia, but very little about other important things that happened outside that but changed world history. Very little mention and no narration is made about the space program, the Man on the Moon, and Lyndon Johnson's \"Great Society\" project; the conflicts in the Middle East and the energy crisis. However the music scene of that time gets ample coverage; also later on the lesser known background facts around the collapse of the Soviet Block.<br />Somehow the proportion seems odd: a huge percentage of the work covers the Kennedy era, second to that comes Nixon, and then the plot jumps almost right into the collapse of the Soviet Union and the East Block, leaving some funny gaps in between.<br /><br />The action itself is mostly described in fictional conversations between the main characters of this novel, which can become somewhat bore-some at times, and take life away from the plot, occasionally even from the characters themselves. And, without being prudish: IMHO one could live very well with only half of the sex descriptions, which moreover leave the impression of being puberty phantasies rather than real life. But overall: This book is well written, and can be classified as a page turner!<br /><br />This third tome of what was meant as a 20th Century trilogy covers historical events and characters which are in our most recent past and about which there still are strong, sometimes hard personal feelings out in the readership.<br />This is understandable, also the fact that we might agree or disagree with some of the points of view the author wants to express through the fictional characters in this novel.<br />However, a product review is not the place to ventilate those feelings criticizing the author's alleged political, personal or national views... which, again to be said, are expressed by the fictional characters inside their time and environment; not by the author himself.", "review_title": "Third book of a great trilogy", "timestamp": 1416010860000}, {"product_title": "Hammock Sky Large Brazilian Hammock Chair Cotton Weave - Extra Long Bed - Hanging Chair for Yard, Bedroom, Porch, Indoor/Outdoor (Blue & Green)", "review_text": "Love this!

No matter how hard I tried to pull and tug and adjust the components of the lid, I couldn't get it to stop leaking on certain days. The stopper grew mildew that wouldn't come off. Not with baking soda, vinegar, hot water, or scouring pads. Now the stopper has mysteriously vanished (I might have thrown it away in frustration. I don't remember) and I need a new one. The replacement lid according to their website would cost me nearly as much as a whole mug $25 brand new. The stopper cover set a.k.a. lid is $12.10, and the stopper set a.k.a. mouthpiece is $8.65 for a total of $20.75. (The lid gasket alone is $6.70.)  I'm only considering buying the whole lid again because I've had so many problems with leaking.<br /><br />Also, it's not easy to clean. I stopped adding any milk to my teas or coffee after it left behind a brown skin that eventually came off with months of exposure to hot water. I was too cheap to buy a bottle brush to accommodate the narrow opening and tall size, so I used a scouring pad that I pushed down and around pretty hard with a wooden spoon. It didn't work well. But when the skin finally came out, it came out beautifully in chunks that left behind gleaming steel. The lid itself also has many crevices for stains, but a brush can whittle it away.<br /><br />In addition to premium temperature control, it has premium durability. I've dropped the mug many times, which has only left behind the slightest of dents. The color is still as blue as ever with no chipping.<br /><br />Overall, the lid is a major inconvenience, but the mug most definitely keeps your hot drinks painfully hot and ice solid for hours. I couldn't comfortably drink my hot teas or coffee in the morning until it was well past lunch time, and there'd be little cold water to drink throughout the day with all the ice so well preserved. This mug is awesome. A brand new Zojirushi is hard to justify due to waste since right now I'm still using mine with decent satisfaction without the stopper gasket. I just have to never turn it too far from a vertical position. However, I can get a more well-rounded mug for the same price of Zojirushi replacement parts, or cheaper.

It's zipper's slider head and pull tab are metal (good!), but its chain is plastic (less durable than metal).<br /><br />How well does it insulate? Nobody likes to discard formula or breast milk because it stayed warm for too long, so I took some objective measurements of bottle temperature over time. I compared Dr. Brown's bag with the cheap, free zipper bag that we got for free from the hospital.<br /><br />For my test, no ice pack was used to simulate cases where the pack has melted, and insulation is most important.<br />Both bottles were chilled to 40F (4.4C). The temperature was logged in real-time using a Weber thermometer with new probes.<br />PROBE1 is the Dr. Brown's tote; PROBE2 is the generic tote you see on the right.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: The Dr. Brown's tote insulates no better than the generic tote. The generic tote uses closed-cell foam (based on how it feels--I didn't cut it open) whereas the Dr. Brown's tote uses neoprene, which is more durable but feels thinner. The neoprene, if unlined, also allows moisture through. This probably reduces condensation build-up, but may not insulate quite as well.<br /><br />Please note that the hospital bag is somewhat smaller, so there is less surface area to lose heat. A more formal scientific test would have also held the probes at the center of the bottle, which I could not do. Finally, the Weber iGrill is not a high-precision instrument; it is meant for grills where a degree or two makes little difference, and where temperatures tend to be high. In other words, this is not a completely fair comparison, but it should be close enough. The readings are also helpful for bottle life estimation.", "review_title": "Well-made, but could insulate better", "timestamp": 1497202309965}, {"product_title": "My Thrill Club Monthly Book Subscription Box - Includes Two Surprise Books and A Unique GIft Every Month", "review_text": "I was really looking forward to starting this book subscription but the quality is horrible, the books came looking beat up and used, the so called surprise wasn\u2019t even included in the box and the books chosen are substandard.

I wasn't sure what to expect and was really happily surprised. Here are the pros and cons:<br /><br />1. I have had two leaks so far only and that was after prolonged use during the evenings only. I do not normally switch to night time diapers so this has also happened with other brands (to include huggies, honest etc). Those two leaks were a result of very very full diapers the next morning especially since my child still breastfeeds at night. During the day I have not noticed any leaks at all.<br />2. I find the design much better than Honest. For some reason they fit better and have more flexibility. Other brands tend to feel less fitted and more boxy if that makes sense.<br />3. I don't mind the color of these. However, someone did come over and state &#34;Are these diapers dirty?&#34; and I was puzzled until they pointed out that the color (which is not due to dirty diapers but due to their design) was just a little strange to them. I personally didn't mind this but thought I'd include it since it was part of my observation when using these diapers.<br /><br />The price is up there with Honest in my opinion (at least where I shop which is typically Target). Usually not your cheapest so this is a con. However, I tested these when they were on clearance so they were thus comparable to a few other brands. This might not be the case typically though so I'd also like to make this clear.", "review_title": "Color might seem strange, better fit, few leaks unless used as a night time diaper in some instances", "timestamp": 1460687285000}, {"product_title": "Aussie Moist Shampoo with Pump, 29.2 Fl Oz", "review_text": "great for itchy scalp", "review_title": "Four Stars", "timestamp": 1499618884843}, {"product_title": "Evergreen TKTCS5047NG Compatible With 99-08 Dodge Jeep Mitsubishi 4.7 SOHC 16V VIN J, N, P Timing Chain Kit w/o Gears Timing Cover Gaskets", "review_text": "metal stamped timing cover gasket arrived bent due to box shipped in being to narrow, seller sent another and the same thing happened so i used it anyways, pictures are of the second one sent the first was much worse. chains will bind/kink due to the links not being media tossed so you really need to soak them in oil before trying to put them on. for the price point on this kit you just can not complain since they do work and are quiet, for how long who knows haha. the tensioners do have screens in the back to prevent large chunks of whatever from blocking oil pressure to them unlike oem that do plug up and rattle. the only thing missing is a thermostat gasket if you intend to reuse yours. i did not use the chinese rtv that came in the box, it is misleading as it has little united states flags on it giving the impression of made in the usa , it is not made in the usa but in china and thin once i opened and squeezed some out i threw it in the trash, i used permatex black instead. all of the timing chains,tensioners and guides were made in Taiwan. the gasket and seals did not have a country of origin markings so i assume their from china. i would recommend this kit  due to is price point and the parts seem to be pretty good quality just expect what i stated above.", "review_title": "good price", "timestamp": 1491669167000}, {"product_title": "Richard Pryor Dove LP", "review_text": "His first album....so funny that you'll listen over & over again.

It also stained my bathroom sink, and I can't get the stain out, even with a bleach-containing cleaner. So now, I'm careful to put it on a cotton pad and not let it leak onto the sink.

So, I ported it over to the PC I built for this purpose.  Know that this machine is no slouch:  it is based on a Gigabyte MB, with AMD 1090T 6-core processor, 16 GB RAM, and 4 HDDs including an SSD for Drive C:.<br /><br />When I took on a herculean task of scanning in all of my photos and slides, plus those of my dad, I had to find a way to do this within my budget.  I had on hand a Canoscan 9000F for the iMac, and I hooked up the HP Scanjet G4050 to the PC.  The Canoscan 9000F is a very good photo scanner, with easy to use software for scanning and cataloging.  However, the TMA for slide scanning only holds 4 slides, yet the scanning is rapid and usually takes 2 minutes for 4 slides.  The HP has a TMA that holds 16 slides, but wow!, it is slow.  It wants to scan slides at 300 dpi, much to low to correct any problems with Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom.  Setting the resolution at 1200 dpi, not unusual for slides, results in about 2 hours being spent scanning the 16 slides in.  If you enable further correction, such as correct exposure, or remove scratches and dust, it takes even longer.  Apparently the scanner has too little processing power, and does not rely on the computer for correction.<br /><br />Bottom line:  don't get the HP Scan Jet G4050/B1H for slide scanning if you have a big job, or just plan on a morning for 16 slides, and an afternoon for 16 more.

However, my father took my axe and hasn't returned it.  So, when a 9\" diameter tree fell on my property, my friend and I went to work with this tool.  I wasn't even going to attempt such a feat, but he started on it with one-handed swings and I saw him make his way through in just a few minutes.  When it came to the next cut, I took over and used both hands with a full axe grip and chips were flying with every swing.  My axe handle is 24\" and this one is 22\".  It was close enough to the length and weight of my axe that I actually found this to cut BETTER than my old wood axe.  My axe head is wedge-shaped, like most, but the slim profile of this hawk's head let me cut DEEP with every swing.  It never got stuck and the straight handle never slipped from my hands.<br /><br />I have since reacquired my axe, but I honestly haven't touched it since my success with this Rifleman's Hawk.  I wish I had taken pictures of our work that day to post here.  Standing on a log while swinging away with a huge tomahawk would have been a unique memory to capture.  I have since bought other models of Cold Steel like this.  The Pipe Hawk has a slimmer handle that is just as long, but I find that 22\" is too much handle for a such a light head.  I was spoiled by the deep bite of this Rifleman's hawk, I must admit.  Some people might say \"For the weight of this item, you could carry a real axe\"  While this might be true, fashioning a replacement handle for an axe would be far more difficult if anything were to happen to this one.  Plus, I found this style much more suited to fine work than a thick axe head.<br /><br />This item has sat in my damp garage for years and has only tiny dots of surface-level rust on the hammer head.  Every time I use the blade, the edge gets cleaned of any such marks.  The black coating on this item prevents the majority of surface area from even being exposed to such risk.  The handle and head were tight when I received the item and remain so after 30 big cuts through logs and hundreds of smaller branches.  I should also note, that this item is not a toy; wear gloves and eye protection. (especially when making chips fly with both hands).<br /><br />This is not the advertised use for this item, but if it were an axe instead of a hawk, I'd still give it five stars.", "review_title": "Not just a good hawk, but a very fine axe", "timestamp": 1422051703000}, {"product_title": "Earth Wind & Fire Greatest Hits", "review_text": "great", "review_title": "Five Stars", "timestamp": 1436540136000}, {"product_title": "Fahrenheat WHT500 Utility Heater, Medium, Off- White", "review_text": "In 2016 we put this in a small insulated well house (4x4x4 foot) on a property that had only power and a new well to keep the pressure tank and well head from freezing.

So I took a chance and I'm glad I did. The layout is almost exactly what I'm used to, the action of the keys is decisive, and the two different displays are easy to read.  I appreciate that it turns on silently (the Casio would forward some of the paper roll every time it was turned on, even in no-print mode, and it was the paper-moving mechanism that eventually failed and provided a permanent error in the display).  I even figured out and used the correction feature when I was working on my tax return, apparently a common feature on newer machines that I didn't even know existed since I've been using a dinosaur for so long.

It's the same old follow-the-path structure and apart from a few unsuspected scares (don't have a weak heart when playing this one), has no replay value except for multiplayer - which I'd recommend, MINIMUM, a 1.5/1.0 DSL connection.  Doom3 hogs internet bandwidth even more than UT2k4, et al.<br /><br />Id could take a lesson from Atari about how to better use bandwidth.  UT2k4 is exceptional by comparison and is surprisingly playable on 256k down/up speeds.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good game, but don't pay more than $18 for the original and $15 for the Ressurection add-on pak (so wait a few months).  Anything more is exploitation of an uncreative product that should be faster with online play.  (All the players and texture/bump maps are on each PC, what exactly are they sending over the internet that's dragging things down?!)<br /><br />Looks very nice and is playable even on my lowly hardware (see below), but it adds nothing to the genre (it even goes backwards; the flashlight has an infinite power source, good grief).<br /><br />My system:<br /><br />Abit NF7 mobo (nforce2 chipset, dual DDL).<br /><br />Athlon XP 2100+ @ 2700+ C{U<br /><br />1GB RAM (2x512 modules)<br /><br />Nvidia geforce 5900fx video (128MB RAM) from BFG<br /><br />SB Audigy<br /><br />Again, for solo play it'll run great at 1024x768, ultra quality.

When I put hot water at approximately 140\u00b0 temperature into this thermos mug, it stayed hot for approximately 3-4 hours. Cold drinks stayed cold about 2 hours.<br /><br />The lid of this travel mug is so unusual in its construction that I could not figure it out without my husband's help. There is a small silicone bar on the top of the upper silicone portion of the black, plastic lid. When you shove it forward, the lid is closed and leak proof. When you shove it backwards, the top portion of the lid tilts slightly upward, about 20\u00b0, to allow liquid to be poured out into a glass or mug, or to be tipped into the mouth.<br /><br />There is a huge problem with this design. If you take off the lid, you will discover that there is no access for cleaning the area that is underneath the tiltable, upper part of the lid. There is a small, inaccessible compartment there which can become a hotbed for retaining food particles and growing toxic mold, because there is no possibility for reaching any kind of implement, even a tiny, straw-cleaning brush, inside that area and cleaning it. The only way to stop a build-up of rotting food particles and mold--and there is no guarantee it would even work--might be to soak the lid in diluted vinegar or hydrogen peroxide on a daily basis. Which of course, would be a huge hassle and, over time, with very likely damage the lid by eating away at its finish.<br /><br />If you opt to wash this travel thermos in the dishwasher, in hopes that the hard swish of hot water will solve the problem of the lid, you will have a potential issue of water getting trapped up inside the lid. Which means you will have to shake it out thoroughly, and even so, not be guaranteed that you won't be growing mold inside the lid. The dishwasher may not be able to remove all the food particles within the lid from coffee or tea or any creamer products or sweeteners that you might have put in your coffee or tea.<br /><br />If you choose to purchase this product, for the above reasons, I would not recommend putting anything in this mug except water and never putting it to your lips and drinking out of it. Drinking from it will impart saliva to that uncleanable portion of the lid, and that too can cause mold buildup.<br /><br />For me, this design flaw is a problem of the manufacturer choosing a sleek appearance over hygienic functionality, resulting in a major product failure.", "review_title": "Severe design flaw", "timestamp": 1579558005495}]

First of all it's missing the ability to shoot B&W photos.  Although you can edit your photos with basic photo software later, you no longer have the ability to view and shoot B&W photos.  Another feature greatly missed is the 2\" swivel LCD display.  This allowed you to hold your camera over your head, out over a ledge or lower than eye level without you having to get in those positions to take a picture.  Most disappointing, though is the slow response time.  Being new to the 5 megapixel realm, this may be common.  But taking one picture to the next, especially when using a flash, can take up to 7 seconds.  A cool new feature is Burst mode, which allows you to take 3 photos in a little over a second.  But again going from one set of three to the next takes a whopping 9 seconds.<br />Now for the good stuff.  Being an \"advanced\" point-and-shoot user, I like the ease of use along with the more advanced controls the DSC-P10 gives you in taking photos.  I'm learning how to use the histogram to get desired lighting effects.  The menus are fairly easy to learn and navigate and the compact size makes it easy to carry.  The Burst mode, mentioned earlier, is a cool feature.  And, as was with the case of the DSC-S50, I'm very satisfied with the sharp picture quality.  A great improvement in the Movie mode is the 640 x 480 resolution and no longer being limited to 15 seconds worth of video.  Now your only limitation is the size of your memory stick.<br />One recommendation if you decide on this camera, get a spare battery or the starter kit that includes the spare battery.  The battery life on this camera is about an hour and fifteen minutes.  Not long enough for an event or a day out on vacation.  Also get at least a 128 MB memory stick.  The 32 MB stick that comes with the camera only gives you 24 pictures in the 5 megapixel mode.

It always stays clean, it's smooth to use, and it's just an overall great product. Though I wish that there were enough features like the Razer Firefly, but oh well. It's a very nice mat, but only buy it if you have the spare money and you want something that looks really nice with your environment.<br /><br />It also absorbs some spills. I spilled a can of 24oz Baja Blase Mountain Dew on it, and when I rushed to clean it up, it absorbed into the mouse mat. (It could have been worse, but I cleaned it up.)

None of my humidity meters showed any uptick when this unit was on (20% was the lowest reading).  This unit is on my main furnace providing heat/humidity to the lower two floors.  There was no noticeable change in humidity in those floors with this unit on.  I had it professionally installed, and they installed the automatic controls for the unit.  To deal with my humidity problem in the winters, I have reverted to using portable Air-O-Swiss units.  They are excellent, but only provide humidification to a single room, and have to be refilled every night.

Perfect Travel Watercolor Set for Artists, Amateur Hobbyists and Painting Lovers", "review_text": "[[VIDEOID:ebd63535c957b18b31837fd31bbf99aa]] I purchased this Artistro Watercolor Paint to try out since it was a full set of supplies at an affordable price.<br /><br />This set includes 40 Standard Watercolors, 4 Fluorescent Watercolors, 4 Metallic Watercolors, 10 pieces of 300g Watercolor Paper, Swatch Sheet, Eraser, Sponge, Brush, Pencil, and Water Brush Pen.<br /><br />It comes in a soft pink drawstring bag with a metal rose colored tin to hold all the supplies making it easy to transport to wherever you plan to do art.  The tin is nicely designed on the outside and seems like it will hold up well. It's easy to open and close and holds all the supplies perfectly!<br /><br />WATERCOLORS: The set includes a great selection of shades, which I like a lot. The watercolors don't need much water to soften them so the brush picks them up almost immediately. They are vibrant and have a great saturation. They glide on the paper smoothly and blend extremely well. There is a slight graininess to the watercolors after they dry if thin out with water but for someone who likes visual texture, esspecially with my landscape paintings, it's not an issue. Overall, they are a good quality for the affordable price and would be perfect for beginner to intermediate watercolor artists.<br /><br />BRUSH: The brush doesn't have a size, but when compared to my other brushes, it seems to be about a size 2. The bristles have kept their shape through multiple uses and I haven't had any issues with shedding so far. My go to brush is a size 4, so this is smaller than I prefer but I could see using for smaller details.<br /><br />SWATCH SHEET: I like to reference my swatch sheet a lot when I paint, so I was excited to see this included in the set. After looking at it, I noticed that the swatches did not line up with the watercolors in the tin. It take more time and a little frustration to have to search for the color instead of just looking down from the swatch to the watercolor. I see why they did it that way so their company name would be on the sheet, but I would recommend changing the swatch sheet to line up exactly with the watercolor rows and making the company name smaller - more out of the way. I will be making my own swatch sheet so it lines up more accurately with all the watercolor pan rows.<br /><br />WATER BRUSH PEN: I've never used a water brush before, but I do like this water brush pen because it is easy to fill, the seal stays tight so I haven't had any issues with the water leaking out, and the button to release the water is easy to push to adjust the flow. It does bubble up a bit when pushed multiple times in a short period but I think it's just something I have to learn better. It feels good in my hand and will be great for on the go painting where I don't have access to water as easily. I'd love to see this brush come in other shapes and sizes in the future.<br /><br />PENCIL AND ERASER: These are decent basic drawing tools which I start most of my watercolor painting with. They do a good job with my preliminary sketching.<br /><br />SPONGE: I'm not exactly sure what the sponge is used for other than pushing out the excess water and color from the water brush pen. It soaks up the water very quickly though, so I've had to continually wring it out. I'd like to see a thicker sponge that will take more water changes.<br /><br />PAPER: I wasn't a fan of the included watercolor paper. The paper has a very beginner quality to it compared to the paper I currently use, but I'm used to using a more expensive paper. The texture is a bit much and the more an area is painted on, the texture goes away leaving a smooth spot. The paper also warps pretty quickly, even with the edges taped down. My biggest issue with the paper was that it is advertised as size 5\"x8\" but when measured, it's actually 4 3/4\"x8 1/4\" so I can't get a true 5\"x7\" piece out of it.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this set to any beginner or intermediate watercolor artist, especially for the price.

If you are looking for the best Indian music out there, this is probably not for you.  The artists are competent, but cannot really be compared to the late Ravi Shankar or Ali Akbar Khan.  Furthermore, the 1950's technology does not make a record that knocks your socks off.  But if you approach this recording in this manner, I fear that you will be missing a lot.<br /><br />There are really only a a small handful of recordings of Indian classical music produced in the West during the 1950s.  Some like the Angel records release of Ali Akbar Khan's Music of India: Morning and Evening Ragas (1955), or Ravi Shankar's Three Ragas (1956) are viewed as classics. But albums like this do not give a complete picture of the emergence of this genre in the West.<br /><br />During the 1950s and 1960s the marketing classification of &#34;World Music&#34; did not exist.  Record companies were just beginning to experiment with the distribution of classical Indian musicians.  But both the music companies as well as the public did not really know what to think of this.  Were they ethnomusicological recordings?  Were they music that was just for the Beat / Hippie crowd?  There were no answers, so every release was a marketing test.<br /><br />This recording is a valuable insight into this environment.  The record cover went into extensive detail as to the music and instruments.  This is something that is never done today.  Musicians like Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan went to extreme lengths to &#34;blow you away&#34; with their technical virtuosity.  In the process, basic musical structures and concepts were often obscured to all except the most well trained of listeners.  This recording on the other hand, was cleaner and illustrated basic concepts of raga and tala much more clearly.  I feel that it showed the basic structure of an Indian performance much more clearly than many other recording of the period.<br /><br />I for one, was deeply influenced by this recording.  I suspect that many other were too.  As is often the case the most influential musicians are often not the most famous.<br /><br />So the bottom line is clear.  If you have a particular interest in the early development of the marketing concept of World Music, I recommend that you find a copy of this recording (if you can find one).", "review_title": "not an easy answer.", "timestamp": 1388078011000}, {"product_title": "A-Tech 1GB DDR2 667MHz UDIMM PC2-5300 CL5 1.8V DIMM Non-ECC Unbuffered Desktop RAM Memory Module", "review_text": "Exactly as described.

The letters the crayons have written to their owner are hilarious, and having each separate letter written on the left side of the spread in a child's handwriting, with the right side showing a child-like drawing of objects that shade is typically used to color, is a sure-fire way to immediately draw a youngster in.  Nice collaborative effort by author and illustrator!<br /><br />Our older grandsons have a lot of fun voicing the letters written by &quot;Red&quot;, who even has to work on holidays (i.e. coloring Santas, Valentines), &quot;Purple&quot; is going to &quot;completely lose it&quot; if Duncan doesn't start coloring inside of the lines soon, &quot;Beige&quot; (who is &quot;BEIGE and PROUD!&quot;) is jealous of &quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;Gray&quot; is tired of getting all of the BIG jobs (like coloring elephants, rhinos, hippos and HUMPBACK WHALES), &quot;White&quot; is feeling underutilized, &quot;Black&quot; doesn't find it fair that he's only used as an outline to brightly colored objects, &quot;Green&quot; is a peacemaker type (or a tattle tale, depending upon your outlook!), who claims to be very happy with his work, congratulates Duncan on his coloring career, but wants to inform him of the bickering between &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Orange&quot; over who gets to be the color of the sun, with &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Orange&quot; writing separate letters each stating their case along with documented proof, &quot;Blue&quot; is overworked and now just a stub who can't even see over the box railing any longer, &quot;Pink&quot; believes she's experiencing discrimination because she's &quot;a girls' color&quot;, while &quot;Peach&quot; is completely unwrapped (&quot;I don't even have any underwear!&quot;) and embarrassed to leave the box.  Wow - what a conundrum!  But the amazingly colorful picture Duncan creates - allowing each crayon to stretch beyond their typical usages - ends up earning him an A for coloring and an A+ for creativity!<br /><br />Speaking both as a mom and now a grandma, I've come to believe that one of the most important things an adult can do for their children/grandchildren is to strongly encourage them to be creative and use their imaginations.  Whether he/she eventually becomes an astrophysicist, a police officer, a stay-at-home mom or dad, etc., EVERY occupation requires the use of those mental tools when called upon to problem-solve and come up with solutions.  How many bosses out there couldn't learn a thing or two from Duncan?  Excellent little book that youngsters are going to really enjoy... and that adults can take a lesson from as well.", "review_title": "Here's a book that hasn't seen too many days just sitting on the bookshelf!", "timestamp": 1472842156000}, {"product_title": "Whirlpool 2252130 Icemaker Auger Motor Assembly", "review_text": "I ordered this motor on Thursday, and with expedited shipping it was on my front door by Friday evening.  The best part was that even with this custom, first rate, speedy delivery, it was still less than what my nearby part store was selling it for.  To be fair, I would have paid the extra to buy it locally if for no other reason than to avoid having refrigerator parts lying around the kitchen for an extra 24 hours, but hey, I'm not complaining.<br /><br />For those considering replacing this part yourselves, it is really quite easy.  If your refrigerator is like mine, you need to slide out the tray on the outside of the water/ice dispenser, revealing two screws holding the control panel in place.  This slides upwards and out, revealing the inner parts of the water dispenser and electrical to the motor.  Take pictures if you need to as you remove 6 or 8 more screws, nothing complicated, to get to the motor.  Also, on the inside (cold side) of the door panel, you will need to remove the socket the engages the bottom of the ice bucket.  This comes out as two screws, and engagement interface and a spring (don't worry, it's not one of those that is impossible to get back together).<br /><br />The motor is driven by the two heavier wires, and I guess you could test the unit with an ohm meter.  Mine went to 0 when I checked these two prongs, but I (oops) never checked the new motor before I installed it, so I don't know what a normal reading would be.  The symptom of mine was the ice drop flap open and closed when I pressed the ice paddle, but the motor never turned.<br /><br />Anyway, the new motor is great, my wife is happy, we have crushed ice again, and the old motor is in the recycle bin.  Good luck.", "review_title": "Great motor, great service", "timestamp": 1350513643000}]

The screws for the hinge mounts are a tad thin in my opinion and are unquestionably the toughest part of the grill to assemble without an extra pair of hands, but otherwise everything is quite nice and adequately built.  The starter button works every single time after I made sure to press the connection between the button and the ignitor in all the way.  I do have an issue with the warming rack having a missing \"spoke\".  I will include a picture of that later.  The main cooking grates are pretty thin.  I would happily pay extra for some nice coated cast iron.  The cooking surface is quite large for a tabletop grill.  The legs hold the grill very steady on a flat surface.  It's a very impressive design.<br /><br />Some previous reviews mention missing \"wheels\" that help the legs unfold, but no such part exists.  There are no \"wheels\" in this design.  There are bent spring washers required for the tension aspect of the mount to keep the leg mounts feeling solid as the legs are unfolded and folded back and will wear over time.  Maybe that is what the reviewer was talking about.  I had all those bent spring washers that I needed and was only missing a single flat washer (I simply made up for that by using one less flat washer in a much less critical area)  I am very satisfied with the number of parts received and had no extra parts left over at all.<br /><br />The assembly requirement is extensive, but the instructions were very good in my opinion and I completed it in about an hour at a very leisurely pace.  I am very mechanically inclined and typically have no issues assembling things, but this grill does not require a degree in mechanical engineering to assemble.  Just a little patience, a pair of pliers and a couple of phillips screwdrivers are all you need.  You have to be careful to not over-tighten a couple of screws that are threaded directly into sheet metal instead of with nuts to hold them in place.  Just a little common sense is required.<br /><br />First use, it was a very windy and cold night to be using a grill, but it performed admirably.  It takes a bit longer to cook steaks in this grill than it would in a larger grill with more heated mass (aka cast iron grates), but it did make great steaks.  My girlfriend proclaimed it was the best steak she has ever had.  Heat seemed to be pretty even, but the steaks were in the center of the grill.  The ribeyes had a lot of flare-ups, but nothing too severe and that cut always seems to have flare-ups regardless of what kind of grill you cook them in.  Dropped the temp to low to keep things from getting out of control and the added heat from the flare-ups kept the grill running pretty hot (I like to run a very hot grill).  The grill does seem to run quite a bit hotter at the front and back edges of the grill.  You have to rotate your food a bit using this grill.  It's not the end of the world, but it's annoying and requires more of your attention and time to cook well with this grill.  The heat deflector seems to be just a tad too effective.  Think I will take a drill and pop some holes in that bad boy to make the heat a bit more even.<br /><br />I recommend this grill.  There is a lot of value for the money here and it works like a champ.  I am happy with my purchase despite the missing spoke on the warmer and the uneven heat.", "review_title": "Good design.

After about 24 hours it was ready to use.  Initially, it was flawless and my wife and I really enjoyed it.  After two weeks, three troubling issues became persistent as other reviewers have mentioned.<br />1. Air has to added daily or it goes really soft.  Since at this point you cannot use the pump because you would have to disconnect it and empty the water.  I devised a setup with a shop vac exhaust that works basically the same as the pump motor without disconnecting the pump.  I did find some glue and fixed the leak. The pressure gauge is useless so you never really know how much air you have in it other than to feel it.<br />2. Filters clogs in about a week which has to be taken out (the gunk collected in the filter comes off the filter when removing it and ends up back in the tub). The dirty filters greatly slows down the water flow and affects temperature and clarity.<br />We will continue to use it but the air loss really puts a damper on our enthusiasm.  I will check for leaks with soapy water and hope to solve it.  Not sure if it is worth the cost, right now we are thinking we should have saved-up for a fiberglass tub.<br /><br />Update:  The air leaks have somewhat been fixed (still leaks slowly) but the pumps leak badly.  The first leaky pump was replaced within a week.  But after two weeks with the second pump, it leaked even worse than the first one. They will replace it but said this is the last pump they will replace for us, still waiting for the pump. Overall, when it's working, it's a great little Hot Tub but ours has seldom worked properly and we're getting pretty discouraged.  Also, I absolutely hate the 72 hour auto shut-off. I have to go to the Hot Tub and unplug it to ensure it will work another 72 hours.  The manual say's just unlock it but that doesn't always work to get you 72 more hours.

We have used this in neighborhood streets through snow as well as city streets and public transit.  I was surprised how well it handled the winter elements and uneven ground.  My child was having a blast. While it doesn\u2019t have any suspension, the cloth and strap construction makes the bumps less jarring for the passenger.<br /><br />The lightweight and one-handle fold system makes for hassle-free travel through urban areas.  It is light to lift and folds down easily and compactly for stowing on trains, rail cars or personal vehicles.  Additionally, it maneuvers so smoothly and can handle the tightest navigations, through clothing store racks, crowded areas and can dodge all the things necessary on the sidewalk.<br /><br />It is a comfortable ride for the little ones, I have had kids 1, 2, 3 and 6 all enjoying the ride.  We have not tried the 3-in-1 travel system with the car seat or the cot.  It has a medium amount of storage and the overhead cover is ideal for choosing the amount of coverage needed.<br /><br />Overall, the description above is accurate and we have enjoyed the ease of use and compact storage of this stroller.<br /><br />Things to note:<br />We own the black fabric model and I probably wouldn\u2019t choose this again. The black fabric shows all. This was obvious after the first ride when my son\u2019s shoes prints were left behind on the foot rest.<br /><br />Seat reclining adjuster was limited due to the seams in the straps; it could not move beyond them so it was stuck in a slightly reclined position (see photos).

[{"product_title": "Cobra ACXT1035R FLT CAMO Waterproof Walkie Talkies for Adults - Rechargeable, Floats, 22 Channels, Long Range 37-Mile Two-Way Radio Set (2-Pack)", "review_text": "I like to use walkie talkies while 4-wheeling, boating, hunting, basically any activity where communication can keep you safe or sometimes keep you from getting horribly lost! Fortunately Ive yet to need then for an emergency but using these I did keep from getting lost in the side tributaries of the Mississippi river while boating this weekend!<br />Ive used very basic walkies in the past and these are the first set Ive used that were more feature packed. I was also pretty excited  that they are waterproof and float which makes them a lot better in the boat. They feel solid and durable for any of my other outdoor uses but so far this summer they are earning their keep on the water.<br />They claim a 37 mile range but those are with perfect conditions that aren't realistic in the real world. Ive personally used then for 3-4 miles on the river. I tried to test them by seeing how far I could drive away from home and still have them work and the results weren't good....under 2 miles. If I knew more about the different channels and experimented with different settings I could try to squeeze every bit of range out they are capable of but since they work at the ranges I'm using most I'm not too worried about it. When I start to use them in the woods I might need to do some tinkering to compensate for the terrains effect on range but I have low expectations.<br />To use a lot of the channels you need to get a license from the govt that will run you about $85. Of course Id suggest you follow the law when it comes to such things but that's up to you to decide. I don't want to even guess how many people out there use these and have no idea they are violating the rules. On one of the last pages of the instructions it tells you about these rules but if didn't already know these rules I easily could have overlooked them in the instructions.<br />These are packed with features but I hate to say that I doubt I have much use of them. The nice thing is that you only need to use the features you want and there's a lot of settings available to let you customize them to work how you need them to. I'm excited to try the VOX feature  for hands free use with a headset.<br />Overall I give these a 4 stars because they work great for my needs so far but a star off because the range is so dependent on where you use them and the 37 mile range they claim isn't realistic.<br />On a side note....I went to the Cobra site to look at the manual and the reviews on their own site are fairly poor. Some of the problems seem to be with the batteries and charging them so after seeing that I replaced the included batteries with some Enerloops and Id recommend putting some quality rechargeable batteries in them.", "review_title": "Happy using them on the river", "timestamp": 1466657672000}, {"product_title": "Prominence Home 80100-01 Bolivar Chrome Contemporary Rustic Ceiling Fan, 52\" LED, Farmhouse/Barnwood Blades", "review_text": "The fan was easy to install.

I would avoid using this in clear streams if you are after trout or other fish with good eye sight, murky or deep water it won't matter.<br />- Difficult to tie, In the wind this is a nightmare.<br />- Difficult to cut, I actually needed a knife to cut this my leatherman surge scissors had trouble cutting it unless the line was very tight.<br />- Knots can slip until you figure out how the line works. When the line gets wet it will slip the knot some. You need to leave extra lead on your knots when you cut off, then pull the knot down harder after you get it wet. When it gets wet the knot can slip unless you do this.<br />- A good fish battle can fray a lot of line.<br /><br />It seems like there are more cons to the pros, but it all depends on what you are fishing for. This is a great go to for Bass and Musky which I have caught on it. However other fish seems to go more towards the mono pan fish, trout, and walleye.

The eggs will roll towards you, which is cool.  They are easy to clean and durable.  Unfortunately after using these for a while, I don't really like them all that much and realized that what I want is a clear plastic version of the classic egg carton.<br /><br />My problems with these:<br />1.  Space.  They take up a lot more room than a basic 18 egg carton.  They are a few inches wider, an inch taller, and an inch or two longer. This bothers me.<br />2.  You have to handle them very gently, lest eggs pop out of the end and smash on the floor.

We bought several different types of bottles, to see which my newborn would prefer.<br /><br />We found that the nipple of this bottle is great- she gets a good latch, she doesn't break off often, she doesn't get overly gassy afterwards, etc..  I agree with one of the other comments left- there does tend to be quite a bit of milk lost out of the side of her mouth; like she's dribbling while on this bottle, compared to the Playtex Ventaire (her first choice of the bottles we've gotten), and it's not the bottle itself that is leaking, so perhaps it is something with the latch after all.<br /><br />The major drawback for us, however, is the very shape of the bottle.  Because it's a squat little bottle, and it has the hour-glass figure shape to it as well as the incredibly large nipple, we have to tip it (or her) at the oddest angle in order to get the last ounce or so.  It's possible that this is not a problem on the larger sized bottle, but on this size, it's a pain.  Particularly when she's only eating up to 2 ounces each feeding out of it.<br /><br />Over all- great nipple; awful bottle.", "review_title": "Great nipple, horrid bottle design", "timestamp": 1373311353000}]

It is a solid performer cleaning the pavers around the pool, walkway and driveway as well as the side of my stucco house, patio furniture, etc.<br /><br />I had some trepidation in purchasing this class of pressure washer. The reviews for electrical washers had a general theme of either good experiences or of cheaply-constructed plastic-ware that was easy to incapacitate. The gas-powered washers were overkill and required effort for the gasoline, oil, etc. with accompanying fumes.<br /><br />Out of the box, there was a minor problem\u2014one of the two plastic wheels was broken. The box was slightly crushed in that area and probably put too much pressure on the plastic hub. I call the manufacturer on the spot and without hassle they put a new wheel in the mail. (I received it five days later.) Assembly wasn't a problem as there are not a lot of things to hook up.<br /><br />Operating the pressure washer was straightforward, though the GFCI plug is quite large and wouldn't fit inside the deep weather-housing of my outlet. I put one of those three-outlet cube converters into the outlet and I was back in business. I extended the pressure hose entirely out of its reel and started washing away. I easily tuned the stream type I wanted (wide fan) and started cleaning. It did an admirable job and cleaned off the mildew and dirt with no trouble. You have to be between two and six inches for the wide fan setting to work; close for porous surfaces and farther away for non-porous surfaces. The wand I normally use has two adjustments: one is for stream shape (point to fan) and the other is for amount/presssure of water.<br /><br />Pros:<br />\u2022  High pressure cleans on the first pass; sometimes it needs a slow first-pass on the more stained, porous pavers<br />\u2022  Reliability and consistency make the effectiveness of the last hour of use the same as the first hour of use<br />\u2022  The washer stands upright (hasn't fallen yet) and is easy to move as the work progresses<br />\u2022  The plastic bib uses a metal coupler for the garden-hose connection. It's sturdy and only leaked once on the garden-hose side.<br />\u2022  I have run this washer for four (almost) continuous hours on several occasions with only a small hiccup, see the comment below<br /><br />Cons:<br />\u2022  The pressure hose keeps looping on itself while unreeled, likely from storage on the built-in hose reel. I'll store this hose in larger loops and hang from the washer to solve that.<br />\u2022  It's noisy, but I haven't seen any in operation that weren't noisy<br />\u2022  The back-splash of debris onto my lower legs when cleaning out the narrow gaps in the pavers is terrific (in a not-so-good-way), though I assume *any* pressure washer will do the same\u2014be prepared to vacuum the pool or hose-down walls afterwards<br />\u2022  I made the mistake of using this to clean some of the plastic\\poly-something pool furniture to get rid of the mold \u2013 it took the top, smooth, layer of plastic off and I'll not repeat that again<br /><br />Comments:<br />\u2022  During long usages, the pressure sometimes goes other-worldly and drops noticeably; it comes back after a minute and has only happened three times in six months<br />\u2022  Cord control can sometimes be a nightmare moving around a pool deck or for other circuitous paths. The garden hose, high-pressure hose and electrical cord magically intertwine. I believe that cord control would be the same on any electrical pressure washer, I just need to be more attentive whenever I move the washer<br /><br />I did not use the soap dispenser and so cannot comment on its effectiveness.

I have cable TV and I purchased a Roku 3 so I could easily transfer Netflix and Amazon prime movies to my TV. All I needed in addition to the Roku was a router, which I fortunately already had.<br /><br />From the time I opened the box, the Roku was up and running in about ten minutes. Knowing what I know now (from my son), I would be able to set up a similar device in 5 minutes or less. After my son explained the simple remote to me, I was on Amazon Prime searching for movies as if I had been doing it for years - thanks Amazon! My major concern was how my wife would like it. Sometimes she seems to think remotes have it out for her. When she got home, I explained the remote, and she had it mastered in less than a minute.<br /><br />My Samsung 52\" TV is playing crystal clear Amazon Prime movies. I cannot imagine how Roku or anyone else could make this device easier to set up and operate with a system similar to mine.<br /><br />If you decide to purchase a Roku 3 from Amazon, and Tiger Direct is your vendor, be prepared for delays and confusion. When mine didn't arrive on time, I contacted Tiger and got confusing and nonsensical responses for three weeks while my Roku was on \"backorder\". While mine was on backorder, Tiger was still advertising the Roku on Amazon as \"In Stock\" and \"Next Day Delivery Available\". They responded to my inquiries but the responses made no sense, kind of like one of those phishing e-mails you get from a foreign country where the syntax is all wrong.

We have a very large house (4100 sq.ft), and about 3/4 of it is carpeted. As long as I run this machine daily in the high traffic rooms, it reduces how often I have to run my Dyson vacuum cleaner. We have 2 dogs who shed (also, I have long hair and I'm always shedding too), and it is very apparent by the amount of hair that gets picked up by this thing.<br /><br />You first need to understand that robotic vacuums--because of their small size--have their limitations. They aren't able to create the same suction force as your normal vacuum cleaner, and they don't have the capacity to hold as much dirt/hair/dust/etc. Therefore, you should expect to have to empty the collection compartment/filter more frequently, depending on how dirty the carpet is. It's not a big deal--it takes two seconds to empty it and the filter, and when you do, you'll be amazed at how much stuff it collected. It runs for about 45 minutes and then needs to go back to its charging station. I have to empty the dust bin and filter every other time I run the machine.<br /><br />It transitions easily from carpet to hard floor, and vise versa. It detects when it approaches a ledge, or &#34;cliff,&#34; and it turns around. It does not go off the edge of a stair or ledge.<br /><br />It is very low profile. It occasionally gets stuck under one couch, but it is low enough that it fits underneath most of our furniture.<br /><br />The noise is fairly low. You're going to hear it, but it's really not bad.<br /><br />I have not sat down and figured out all of the features that this robovac has to offer, but I know that it is WiFi capable, so you can run it remotely using the Ecovacs app. You can set scheduled cleaning times on specified days if you wish. I personally haven't bothered with this yet--I prefer to just eyeball the house each day and see what rooms look like they need vacuuming. It leaves a seemingly random pattern in the carpet. You can select different cleaning pattern modes (perimeter, spot clean, etc.). But it definitely gets the room clean--the carpet has that nice squishy, plushy feel after it's done.<br /><br />My first one had a chip issue and was malfunctioning, but the company is very responsive; they covered the return shipping and immediately sent me a new unit, and I've had no issues with the new one.<br /><br />Since I have so much carpet in my house, I had to order a second vacuum (Roomba 690) to clean the downstairs. The Deebot is definitely less noisy than the Roomba and weighs less. The Deebot is also more low-profile than the Roomba. About the only thing the Roomba has that the Deebot doesn't have is the invisible perimeter.<br /><br />If you are going to buy a robotic vacuum, I highly recommend the N79. If you are on the fence about buying one--suck it up and buy one, seriously. This makes a fantastic Christmas present for your wife, mother-in-law, or whoever, and the price is so much better than other robovacs I've seen. As much as I hate spending money on gadgets and techy things, I don't even remember the $200 I dropped on this robovac because it takes such a huge workload off of me. Just buy it already, and you'll be very happy you did.<br /><br />FYI the company is based in China, and there is no customer support number to call.

They are both great boards for play, and they make picking up after a game easy (you just remove all of one color by hand, then for the second color, just roll the board a bit and tilt it and let the stones slide right into the storage bowl).<br /><br />The white silicone version is one piece, and has a 19 by 19 grid on one side, blank on the other.  It has letters and numbers alongside the grid to assist with go problems, practice, reviews.  It is stretchy and indestructible.  The lines and letters seem not affected by play, and there is no smearing, cracking, etc., along the lines of the playing surface. It arrives folded in a bag as noted in the photo.  It is stark white, and this can be rather glaring if one is accustomed to a wood board; that said, in a dimly lit coffee house, it is visible and clean.  The star points are, for some reason, unnecessarily large. The feature I like most about this board is that the surface holds stones from sliding.  It\u2019s ever so slightly sticky, like rubber would be, and thus the stones cling in place even if a table is nudged...yet the stones are still easily removed by hand for captures.  The part I like least about the board: the creases. The board arrives folded, and that may create the creases, but the photo you see is a board that I have owned for six months, and I have never once folded it again after opening it.  I store it perfectly flat, and when I leave home to play, I roll, but do not fold, it.  Without the creases, it would be ideal.  I have stretched it, draped it over a chair, put it in a warm place, put books on it, etc.  Nope, the creases are in it, as though it was manufactured and, when still warm, the operator folded it into its final shape for packaging before it was thoroughly cooled.  I own three of this exact same board and they are all the same.  It\u2019s sad to see this trait on such a fine board.  As of this writing, this boards is about fifteen percent less expensive than the mousepad board.  This is my favorite of the two models.<br /><br />The mousepad board, which is what it is called in the description, is a brown cloth top glued to a black rubbery back (see photo).  It is like a thin mousepad. Thinner than the one underneath your computer mouse.  It has the same overall dimension as the silicone rubber version, but the board itself is slightly smaller perhaps, yet both boards easily use my 22mm stones without feeling crowded.  The mousepad board does not have numbers and letters alongside the board, which is favored by those that prefer a clean look, but not enjoyed by those teaching or doing self-learning.  The brown may be more appealing to the eye for traditionalists, but is harder to see in low-light situations.  The lines are strong and easily viewed, plus the star points are nicely sized (not oversized like the other board).  Some reviewer mentioned the lines smudging, but I have seen none of that; in fact, I ran my finger hard across the lines trying to smear them and I cannot. The stones stay in place on the board well, but not as \u201csticky\u201d as the silicone version; both are better to prevent stone sliding than wooden boards, though.  I did have an issue with the cloth top, however, in that one of mine (I have two of these) had a small, 2mm cut on it, revealing the black backing.  I simply super glued it so it wouldn\u2019t keep tearing.  I never used a knife or utensil by my board, so no clue why it occurred, but it showed me the vulnerability of the cloth-topped mousepad board.  Also, this board could easily stain if a drink is spilled on it as the liquid would soak into the cloth.  This board, too, suffers from fold creases that will not go away.  I\u2019m afraid to stretch the board for fear of creating more tiny cuts or \u201cpulls\u201d in the cloth top.  Which board has more creases?  Equal between the two, I\u2019d say.<br /><br />Hope this helped someone buying one of these two version of the boards.  I sure like them, but some will not be able to stand the creases. The portability is outstanding, as is the price (but the mousepad one is more expensive than the silicone one).  I have owned vinyl covered chess boards (the standard type used in most chess tournaments) that were stored rolled up and did not have creases; I sure wish one of those existed for Go boards.  But, that said, these are less expensive and good.  I suggest buying one and trying it out for your own Go club, see what you think.  I prefer either of these to my metal on plastic, magnetic boards, or my vinyl rolled magnetic boards.  The size alone\u2014large!\u2014makes it a winner compared to those models.

Every shoulder strap I have had with the CLC 1539 has failed. Very nice bag - shoulder strap needs to be heavier duty to match the bag. Ordered a third party shoulder strap (picture attached - search \"strap J-001\" on Amazon. Lowering rating to 3 stars due to poor quality strap.<br />August 2020 update: Second bag just started ripping at a seam next to the shoulder strap tab. Got another one. Put a piece of lauan plywood in the floor of the center section - works nicely. Two pics of old bag and six of new one attached.<br />March, 2017 update: Been using my second bag for over 2 years of heavy HVAC use now. Zippers and shoulder strap tabs holding up great. Overall bag has also held up very well. Improved clips on shoulder strap and/or holes in tabs should be bigger to allow for easier movement to align when picking up and strap pad wore out at seam and came off - no biggies, just opportunities for improvement by CLC. I keep two DeWalt DW2190 parts cases in the center section - one for screws and other fasteners and one for electrical parts - a great way to always have a wide assortment of parts readily available.<br /><br />My favorite tool bag, despite a couple of shortcomings.  I use it for HVAC service - get ribbed by coworkers for how much I carry.  I have several other tool carriers for specialized purposes, but this carries all I need for routine service calls.<br /><br />Pros:  Overall sturdy bag with plenty of dedicated pockets for quick finding of tools and, as said by others - quick notice of missing tools.  Very compact for what it carries.  Does not let most tools fall out, like others have commented from a more open bag.  I lose much fewer tools with this one.  Great customer service - had a bag replaced for free with NO hassle when shoulder strap tab ripped out.<br /><br />Cons:  Tape measures fairly easily get knocked off - don't use that clip.  I will not use the shoulder strap - when a tab ripped out, the 45# bag fell to the floor in a customers living room and landed about 2' from a small child - sent shivers up my spine.

During the past decade I\u2019ve been using them primarily for automotive/RV work, household wiring, appliance repairs, solar systems, and a few simple electronic projects. For my needs a meter such as this Extech is a pretty good fit.<br /><br />What I like best about this MA445 meter is the clamp - specifically it\u2019s ability to measure Direct Current (DC). Virtually all clamp meters measure Alternating Current (AC) but only meters equipped with special Hall Effect sensors can deal with DC. I purchased my first DC clamp meter about 5 years ago and quickly found that it revolutionized the way I work on cars, trailers, and other low voltage systems.<br /><br />Here\u2019s why.<br /><br />Testing electrical systems usually involves touching probes to bare metal to take a reading (Voltage, Ohms, etc). Sometimes that means you have to cut away insulation, disconnect or cut wires. It can be time consuming, difficult, and possibly dangerous.<br /><br />In contrast, a clamp meter lets you see the current flowing in a wire without exposing any bare metal - simply surround the wire of interest with the jaws. Usually I find this quick and easy, especially with auto and RV systems as they tend to have lot\u2019s of exposed wires that can be easily examined.<br /><br />If you\u2019ve ever tried to diagnose why a car\u2019s battery goes dead after it sits idle for a week you\u2019ll find a sensitive DC clamp meter invaluable.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a meter, I suggest you consider your needs to see if it\u2019s worth spending the extra money on one with a clamp that measures DC current.[1]<br /><br />So, enough of that. Let\u2019s get on with the review of this particular Extech MA445 meter!<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE:<br /><br />Build quality is high. It feels good in my hand, with rubber in the right places (e.g. the thumb operated function wheel). My other Extech meters have been reliable over many years of service, and I expect this one will be as well.<br /><br />The test leads are above average quality. The plastic coating is reasonably flexible. The removable end caps allow you to expose more of the tip when needed. The plugs are a standard size so you can use other styles of leads with this meter if you choose (e.g. alligator clips).<br /><br />The display is good. It has a 1/2\u201d high 4 digit readout which is typical for most meters these days.<br />It lights up brightly if desired, and turns off automatically after 15 seconds.<br /><br />The DC clamp is sensitive enough (0.01 amps) to be useful detecting phantom loads in 12V systems.[2]<br /><br />The meter uses 3 AAA batteries - which are included. I much prefer meters that use AAA\u2019s to those that require expensive, clumsy 9V batteries.<br /><br />The built-in LED flashlight is of moderate brightness. Unlike the display it doesn\u2019t seem to timeout and turn-off automatically. I\u2019ve never had a flashlight equipped meter before, but I expect this is going to come in handy.<br /><br />Non-Contact Voltage detector (NCV) senses the presence of 100 volts or higher. It\u2019s a quick and easy way to see if a wall socket, switch, or appliance is \u201chot\u201d. The tip of the clamp is the most sensitive area of the meter when in this mode and it works very well if you keep this in mind. This is not a new feature however it does seem to work a bit better than a 15 year old meter I compared it to.<br /><br />The meter powers itself off after 15 minutes of idle time. This can be disabled if you wish.<br /><br />A Type K Temperature probe with a heat resistant cable is included. The manual is vague about the temperature measurement capability - it states the meter reads to 1832 degrees F (1000 Celsius) but the included probe \u201cdoes not measure full range of meter\u201d. I did a test using a heat gun and was able read temperatures of 860F (460C) at which point the rubber insulation on the probe began to melt and smoke. That\u2019s a reasonably useful range for my purposes.<br /><br />I like the case - it\u2019s minimalistic, made from thin nylon-like material but it does the job and most importantly I find it quick and easy to use.<br /><br />All the various functions seemed to work reliably for me including voltage, resistance, current, capacitance and frequency. I measured some DC and AC power sources, a few motor capacitors, and some diodes comparing the results to my other meters.<br /><br />This is an auto-ranging meter. That\u2019s mostly a good thing for general purpose meters - it\u2019s simpler to use. Auto-ranging meters take a little longer to produce a result because it has to figure out the most accurate range. I found this particular meter to be quick enough for the things I was measuring.[3]<br /><br />WHAT I DON\u2019T LIKE:<br /><br />Lighted display only stays on 15 seconds. I wish it would stay on longer. Still it\u2019s better than no lighting at all.<br /><br />Included printed manual is incomplete - there is a better one available online.<br /><br />I find this meter comfortable to hold in my medium sized hands. One minor problem is I sometimes tend to press the flashlight button on the side when opening the clamps. I expect I\u2019ll just get used to this.<br /><br />DETAILS and SPECS:<br /><br />Please see the Extech website for detailed specifications - I\u2019m not going to duplicate them here. Following are a few little details you won\u2019t find there.<br /><br />Thermocouple temperature probe has 37&#34; lead.<br /><br />The volt-ohm probes are 41\u201d long.<br /><br />Notes:<br />[1] Some inexpensive DC clamp meters are not sensitive enough to detect phantom loads. Make sure it can detect DC currents of 0.01 Amps or less (i.e. 10 milli-amps or less).<br /><br />[2] The resolution of this Extech meter is 0.01 Amps. It can detect a phantom load so small that it would take 167 days to drain a typical 40 Amp Hour car battery. (i.e. 40AHr / 0.01A = 4000 Hrs = 167 days)<br /><br />[3] If you are curious, there are some excellent explanations of the pros and cons of auto-ranging meters available on the internet.

Violin Concerto", "review_text": "Alexander Goehr's Violin Concerto is a very interesting composition, not easy listening but highly rewarding. The liner notes claim that its first movement is not serial/twelve tone, but it certainly sounds that way. In fact the (relatively short) movement is based on an unfinished series which finds its completion only in the next (twice as extended) movement. The Concerto sounds somewhat like the 2nd Concerto Schoenberg might have written, a quarter-century after his first. Like Schoenberg, it can be very lyrical, but it is a stern, atonal lyricism, not one that is romantic and heart-on-sleeve. In typical Schoenberg fashion, there is gossamer interplay between the soloist and the orchestra, the orchestral writing sounds always contrapuntal rather than chordal, and the powerful orchestral outbursts seem to proceed in spurts. The Concerto is packed with musical events, very dramatic in a rather enigmatic way (there are impressive climaxes but they don't sound like they happen through a simple and predictable linear unfolding) and quite deft and subtle in construction, although that may not strike the casual listener. I've heard recently a number of Concertos from those years (late 1950s to mid-1970s) that, however enjoyable they may have been, sounded much more anonymous in their predictable musical dramaturgy, expression and style (see my reviews of [[ASIN:B000001K5F American Concertos]] on Vox, and of [[ASIN:B000000TN6 Rawsthorne: Violin Concertos Nos. 1 & 2; Improvisations on a Theme of Constant Lambert; Divertimento]]). Hearing Goehr's \"Schoenberg VC# 2\" came as a refreshing and rewarding change, although I recognize (and warn the reader) that this is probably for the cognoscenti, those who can hear \"tunes\" in the music of Schoenberg.<br /><br />Iain Hamilton's Violin Concerto from 1952 is also a very enjoyable work, very lyrical in an anguished manner, tormented and dramatic, dynamic and uplifting in the finale (but still in a rather grim way), although it is written in a more anonymous, modernist but not avant-guarde language similar to the concertos mentioned above - but still quite daring in post-war UK, dominated by the brahmsian and pastoral influences of Elgar and Vaughan Williams (Vaughan Williams wasn't uniformly pastoral, of course). Manoug Parikian acquits himself stupendously well of these two difficult and virtuosic (both digitally and musically) works. Great 1971 sonics.<br /><br />Before this disc I had never heard the name of Iain Hamilton, let alone his music (his representation on disc is very scarce). My loss. The Violin Concerto is more or less where he started, which is not bad, but then he discovered the music of Webern (again, not common in the UK in the 1950s) and moved on. Sinfonia for two orchestras from 1959 is a post-Webern, serial work, and like Goehr's Concerto, it is not an easy work, not \"pretty\" or \"seductive\" or \"songful\", but it is finely whrought with a very elaborate, arch-like architecture, packed with instrumental events and undergoing moods that are alternately impressive and delicate. The recording is from 1966 and it is fine, despite a one-second drop-out that, reading from the Gramophone review (August 1966), was part of the original LP. Alexander Gibson and the Scottish National Orchestra had given the premiere seven years before, so they are the ideal interpreters. On the original LP the Sinfonia was paired with Orr's Symphony and Thea Musgrave's Triptych for tenor and orchestra; EMI has already reissued the former on a similar instalment of its great \"British composers\" series, paired with a fabulous reading of Simpson's First Symphony by Adrian Boult, [[ASIN:B00006YX78 Fricker, Orr, Simpson: Symphonies]], so I hope they will eventually bring back the lattter as well.<br /><br />The liner notes are reproduced from the original LPs and they are outstanding.

I'll update with more use.<br /><br />First, packaging: Simple retail box with cardboard insert.  ... But that's all it needs as shipped from Amazon, as they pack it in an outer box.  The saw arrived in perfect condition.  Contents: Saw, Manual.  No case, but who wants one for a construction saw?<br /><br />Fit and finish: Almost flawless, with just a minor amount of casting roughness inside the blade guard.  Unlike my worm drive (also Skilsaw), no loose bits to tighten up out of the box.  Paint - perfect.  Plastic parts - perfect.<br /><br />Handling:  Great balance, better than most in my experience.  Very comfortable handles.  Trigger is very positive, with a good click.  Firm, without being a pain in the neck.  Bevel and depth levers fall naturally where you expect them.  The blade guard retracts smoothly and easily.  No hangs-up on this one.<br /><br />Construction: Very well-made!  The magnesium parts are properly deburred and smooth.  Everything's tight.  Unlike the Skilsaw worm saw, the bevel quadrant is cast into the foot - it's not a stamped steel part.  The depth quadrant, however, is steel (as you'd expect, given it's length).  The stamped steel wrench stores on-board.  Most look at that as an advantage. I'm dual-minded on that, but the Skilsaw's wrench seems to lock positively in it's slot.  There's a blade lock button that's easily accessed, so no nail or jam-board arrangements are needed for a blade change.<br /><br />Adjustments ... this is where I would downrate the saw slightly, perhaps a half-star.  There is a single bevel stop adjustment.  The saw arrived very slightly off true 0 (or 90, depending on how you look at it).  1/8 turn of the hex screw in the foot fixed that.  No problem with that, of course.  Once set for zero, you're dependent on the cast-in 45 degree stop.  There's no independent 45 stop adjustment.  As this is a cast part, I'd advise anyone buying one to check for a true 45, as castings don't always run true.  Mine is, fortunately.  There is no adjustment to set the foot parallel to the blade that I can divine.  Well, Q/A to the rescue, I guess - mine arrived dead nuts on.  That's exceptional in itself, but I have to say that I've NEVER had a saw that would HOLD its parallelism.  In fact, the first drop is usually all it takes to knock it out of alignment.  So the lack of adjustment concerns me.  (If someone can correct me on this, terrific.)  The design of the foot's attachment, however, works to stiffen the connection more than most.  The cast miter quadrant is part of that.  The way the steel depth quadrant attaches to the body is another.  So the alignment seems more-or-less designed in.  But again - we'll see.  'Cause drops happen, and foot gets it, every time.<br /><br />The motor is terrific.  Lots of power, Smooth-sounding, with none of the typical grind of other saws.  No binding.  No slowing or struggling.  Easily the best-sounding sidewinder I've ever pulled a trigger on, by a long shot, in fact.  A decently long cord.  Longevity of the rubber?  Who knows, but it's soft and pliable as new. Unlike Skilsaw worm saws - and like virtually many other sidewinders - this saw uses a simple two-part hub clamp an bolt to hold the blade.  Calling it a &#34;clutch&#34; is a stretch, but it will allow the blade to slip (if not over-tightened), which is necessary on any direct-drive saw.<br /><br />The included blade is Skilsaw-branded (as in the picture) - not the usual Diablo.  Seems OK enough, but I'd advise treating it as a throwaway and having a decent replacement on hand.<br /><br />All-in-all a terrific saw.  I'd recommend it without hesitation were it not for some doubt about the adjustments.  But it screams quality in most respects, Chinese make notwithstanding.", "review_title": "Almost Perfect", "timestamp": 1503616304022}, {"product_title": "Viva Choose-A-Sheet, Paper Towels, 6 Count (Pack of 1)", "review_text": "My go to toilet paper.

It stretches approximately 100% of its length (i.e., a 6-inch piece will stretch to about 12 inches), which I consider ideal. I use this cordage to stake out corners of a tarp. I carry four loops with me in my pack, each made from a 36&#34; length of this shock cord tied in a knot to make the loop, and weighing about 6 grams per loop (24 grams total for the four loops). In light winds, I run the loops through the lower tie outs of my tarp, making it easy to stake it out snugly, but providing plenty of flex to reduce strain on the tarp and to take up any slack (i.e., eliminate sagging) if the tarp fabric stretches a bit in the weather. In heavier winds, I double each loop so that instead of two strands of 1/8&#34; shock cord at each tie out, I have four strands, which doubles the tension and seems adequately durable.<br /><br />Also nice about 1/8&#34; cordage is the ease of tying knots. It's lighter and less bulky than the more common 1/4&#34; diameter shock cord, and if more strength is needed, it can be looped or double looped as I mentioned above. So I think it's ideal for hiking/camping/bushcraft purposes. Also, the green color is nice: fairly dark and &#34;wilderness&#34; friendly if you prefer to blend in, rather than stick out with brightly colored gear.<br /><br />If there's a downside, some people may not like the rubber core, which does not melt well to fuse the ends with the sheath. In practice, I've found that just melting the sheath and tying off the end in a knot (to make the loops I mentioned above) seems plenty adequate to prevent fraying, so I think it's fine.<br /><br />What more can I say?

I binge-read The Connection in a day and a half and have already recommended it to a few family members both YA-aged and those like myself who love the genre many years later.<br /><br />The Connection is very reminiscent of a lot of the YA supernatural/dystopian/romance series that have risen to popularity - the dynamic between the main characters serves up major Roswell/Divergent/Twilight vibes (in the best of ways). Naturally, I ate it right up. It is angsty and full of all of the teenage feels that make reading a book like this such an awesome escape from reality.<br /><br />I\u2019m a sucker for dual-perspective novels and feel like the alternating POV really lends a hand to the fast-paced nature of this book and to the development of the main characters, Bea and Cash, whose enemies-to-lovers romance is at the core of this novel. Bea\u2019s life is turned upside down when family secrets come to life and she learns of an otherworldly connection to an alien race. She is so much more than a foolish high schooler, which I loved, and she really gives the cocky Cash a run for his money as the two butt heads while he tries to keep her safe to save their respective planets.<br /><br />Aside from the main characters, the secondary characters are also fleshed out in a way that allows the reader to really place themselves within the universe of this book. I didn\u2019t feel like Darla, Tasha and co were sidelined or one-dimensional in the telling of this story.<br /><br />This novel is a sci-fi YA romance, however, it is light on the science fiction aspect, which I actually appreciated. I found it to be the best of both worlds.<br /><br />I\u2019m very much looking forward to the second installment of this series and have added Dana Claire to the list of authors that I now follow.", "review_title": "Can't Wait to Read the Rest of the Blood-Light Trilogy!", "timestamp": 1611715592852}, {"product_title": "all in case - iPhone 5/5s Wallet Case - Card Holder - With Mirror and Attachable Strap - Leopard", "review_text": "It holds 3 cards and a 20.00 bill.
