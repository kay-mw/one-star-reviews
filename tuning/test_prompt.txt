<TASK>

Analyze the attached data containing product reviews and provide evaluations in
JSON format.

<EVALUATION-CRITERIA>

Familiarise yourself with the below criteria, which you will use to generate an
overall quality rating ("score"), which can be any integer greater than or equal
to 0 and less than or equal to 10.

Reviews should be evaluated based on:

1. How detailed and useful the information is.

   - A perfect review will give highly detailed information, e.g. not just
     saying "it works great", but saying why it works great.
   - A perfect review will tend to give contextual information, e.g. "it worked
     great for me, but if you have x characteristic it may not work well"
   - A perfect review will be of a reasonable length. There is no specific
     character limit here, it is about striking a balance between sufficient
     detail whilst avoiding the inclusion of unimportant information.

2. How objective the review is.

   - A perfect review will make very few personal "I" or "my" statements.
   - A perfect review will stick to objective language, using emotive adjectives
     only when warranted. They may say "the manufacturing was sloppy", but would
     not say "the manufacturing was complete garbage".

3. How relevant the review is.

   - A perfect review will be highly relevant to the product, meaning you could
     not copy the review to a completely different product and have it still
     make sense.

I've had a couple of bags that were huge - seriously they resembled what most people would consider a carry-on for a weekend trip - and it felt like I was always trying to find stuff to put in them, stopping just short of the kitchen sink. I like that this purse has a few but not too many little inside pockets for smaller stuff and then a larger one right in the middle featuring a zipper, effectively dividing the main area inside into thirds. It's not huge but it's not at the opposite end of being too small to be at all useful. Currently this purse contains: my makeup bag, a 8\"L x 4\"Wx 1.5\"D wallet, car keys, a d-ring with all my other keys, altoids, perfume rollerball, pepper spray, and an extra hair tie. Like I said before, I carry a lot of stuff with me in my purse!", "review_title": "Not too big, not too small, but just right", "timestamp": 1469158292000}]
