I've had a couple of bags that were huge - seriously they resembled what most people would consider a carry-on for a weekend trip - and it felt like I was always trying to find stuff to put in them, stopping just short of the kitchen sink. I like that this purse has a few but not too many little inside pockets for smaller stuff and then a larger one right in the middle featuring a zipper, effectively dividing the main area inside into thirds. It's not huge but it's not at the opposite end of being too small to be at all useful. Currently this purse contains: my makeup bag, a 8\"L x 4\"Wx 1.5\"D wallet, car keys, a d-ring with all my other keys, altoids, perfume rollerball, pepper spray, and an extra hair tie. Like I said before, I carry a lot of stuff with me in my purse!", "review_title": "Not too big, not too small, but just right", "timestamp": 1469158292000}]
